News fripSide Music Unit Announces Phase 3 Vocalists   posted on 2022-04-24 23:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Mao Uesugi, Hisayo Abe join Phase 2 vocalist Yoshino Nanjō at Sunday's concert    The ""fripSide Phase 2 Final Arena Tour"" ended on Sunday with the announcement of the two vocalists for the fripSide music unit's ""Phase 3.""       The Phase 2 vocalist Yoshino Nanjō started performing ""infinite synthesis"" as the 22nd song on the concert's set list, only to be joined halfway through the song by the Phase 3 vocalists. The emcee then introduced the new vocalists Mao Uesugi (left in images above) and Hisayo Abe (right, Idol Bu Show) before they sang their first song, ""dawn of infinity.""    That song is already playing as the opening theme song for the spring anime The Dawn of the Witch, and is also available on streaming services. The single will ship on May 18 with a second song to be announced later.       Since 2009, the unit fripSide had consisted of vocalist Yoshino Nanjō (Ar Tonelico, Love Live!) and producer/composer/programmer Satoshi Yaginuma. (The previous vocalist was nao from 2002 until she graduated in 2009.) The unit performed the two opening themes for the first A Certain Scientific Railgun series, as well as the opening theme for the original video anime. They also performed theme songs for Koihime Musō (with nao as the vocalist), the Aa Megami-sama original anime video series, and Hayate the Combat Butler! Heaven Is a Place on Earth.    The duo had since performed more songs for A Certain Scientific Railgun franchise as well as Black Bullet, Future Card Buddyfight, Seraph of the End, Schwarzes Marken, Ajin, Clockwork Planet, Dances with the Dragons, Boarding School Juliet, King's Raid and The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest.

News fripSide Music Unit Announces Phase 3 Vocalists   posted on 2022-04-24 23:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Mao Uesugi, Hisayo Abe join Phase 2 vocalist Yoshino Nanjō at Sunday's concert    The ""fripSide Phase 2 Final Arena Tour"" ended on Sunday with the announcement of the two vocalists for the fripSide music unit's ""Phase 3.""       The Phase 2 vocalist Yoshino Nanjō started performing ""infinite synthesis"" as the 22nd song on the concert's set list, only to be joined halfway through the song by the Phase 3 vocalists. The emcee then introduced the new vocalists Mao Uesugi (left in images above) and Hisayo Abe (right, Idol Bu Show) before they sang their first song, ""dawn of infinity.""    That song is already playing as the opening theme song for the spring anime The Dawn of the Witch, and is also available on streaming services. The single will ship on May 18 with a second song to be announced later.       Since 2009, the unit fripSide had consisted of vocalist Yoshino Nanjō (Ar Tonelico, Love Live!) and producer/composer/programmer Satoshi Yaginuma. (The previous vocalist was nao from 2002 until she graduated in 2009.) The unit performed the two opening themes for the first A Certain Scientific Railgun series, as well as the opening theme for the original video anime. They also performed theme songs for Koihime Musō (with nao as the vocalist), the Aa Megami-sama original anime video series, and Hayate the Combat Butler! Heaven Is a Place on Earth.    The duo had since performed more songs for A Certain Scientific Railgun franchise as well as Black Bullet, Future Card Buddyfight, Seraph of the End, Schwarzes Marken, Ajin, Clockwork Planet, Dances with the Dragons, Boarding School Juliet, King's Raid and The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest.

News Ranking of Kings Anime Wins March's Galaxy Award   posted on 2022-04-23 17:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Japanese Broadcast Critics Association awards anime for its depth of characters, multilayered story    The Japanese Broadcast Critics Association announced on Friday that the television anime of Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga won one of the four Galaxy Awards for March.    Since 1963, the Galaxy Awards honor outstanding programs, individuals, and groups with the hope of improving the quality of Japanese broadcast culture. As the anime won a monthly award, it will also be a candidate for the association's yearly Galaxy Awards.    The association stated it selected the anime for its depth of characters, multilayered story, ""remarkably impressive action scenes,"" and expressions of complex feelings.    The Ranking of Kings anime premiered on October 14, and ran for 23 episodes. Crunchyroll and Funimation both streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation also streamed an English dub.    Tōka has been serializing the manga on the user-submitted manga website Manga Hack and other venues since May 2017.    Previous winners in the last few years of the Galaxy Awards includes the live-action television series adaptation of Fumi Yoshinaga's What Did You Eat Yesterday? (Kinō Nani Tabeta?) manga, the GeGeGe no Kitarō anime, the television anime of Sumito Ōwara's Eizōken ni wa Te o Dasu na! (Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) manga, and NHK's three-episode live-action mini-series adaptation of Hirohiko Araki's Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan (Kishibe Rohan wa Ugokanai) manga.

News Ranking of Kings Anime Wins March's Galaxy Award   posted on 2022-04-23 17:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Japanese Broadcast Critics Association awards anime for its depth of characters, multilayered story    The Japanese Broadcast Critics Association announced on Friday that the television anime of Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga won one of the four Galaxy Awards for March.    Since 1963, the Galaxy Awards honor outstanding programs, individuals, and groups with the hope of improving the quality of Japanese broadcast culture. As the anime won a monthly award, it will also be a candidate for the association's yearly Galaxy Awards.    The association stated it selected the anime for its depth of characters, multilayered story, ""remarkably impressive action scenes,"" and expressions of complex feelings.    The Ranking of Kings anime premiered on October 14, and ran for 23 episodes. Crunchyroll and Funimation both streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation also streamed an English dub.    Tōka has been serializing the manga on the user-submitted manga website Manga Hack and other venues since May 2017.    Previous winners in the last few years of the Galaxy Awards includes the live-action television series adaptation of Fumi Yoshinaga's What Did You Eat Yesterday? (Kinō Nani Tabeta?) manga, the GeGeGe no Kitarō anime, the television anime of Sumito Ōwara's Eizōken ni wa Te o Dasu na! (Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) manga, and NHK's three-episode live-action mini-series adaptation of Hirohiko Araki's Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan (Kishibe Rohan wa Ugokanai) manga.

Co-author Shaenon Garrity counts down her favorite manga from the column. ―  Shaenon's Ten Favorite 'House' Manga It falls upon my bowed shoulders to announce the news: House of 1,000 Manga is ending.

House of 1000 Manga is due in four hours, and I've read everything in the house.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?

It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it.

We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be.

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?

Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.

It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).      Back to top                  DRosencraft    Joined: 27 Apr 2010 		    Posts: 529       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 3:34 pm            This one isn't that good, but it's inoffensive enough to skate by so far. The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.

About that (Warning, obvious spoilers!) spoiler[Your deduction is right on the mark, it's Earth, in the future. MC is a  3000 year old combat android built to fight demons that invaded Earth from their world at some point in the future.]       Gotta say, that's one of the dumbest plot threads I've ever seen in my life. I'm a little more interested now just to see how they do on working that into the overall narrative, but a part of me feels like it's just plastered on ""what's the craziest thing we can come up with"" type plotting.

It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).

The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.

It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).      Back to top                  DRosencraft    Joined: 27 Apr 2010 		    Posts: 529       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 3:34 pm            This one isn't that good, but it's inoffensive enough to skate by so far. The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.

It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).

The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.

News The Mandalorian, Star Wars: Visions Both Get Manga Adaptations   posted on 2022-04-25 16:39 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Kamome Shirahama, other manga creators work on Star Wars: Visions; Yūsuke Ōsawa on The Mandalorian     The May issue of Square Enix's Big Gangan magazine revealed on Monday that both the Star Wars: Visions anthology anime and The Mandalorian spinoff series for the Star Wars franchise will have manga adaptations that will debut in the magazine's next issue on May 25.     A number of manga creators will work on the manga adaptation of Star Wars: Visions. Kamome Shirahama (Witch Hat Atelier), who drew the character designs for ""The Elder"" short in the anthology, will draw an adaptation of that short for the magazine's June issue. The other artists include:     Haruichi (Star Wars Leia, Princess of Alderaan) will draw an adaptation of ""Lop and Ochō"" in the July issue   Yūsuke Ōsawa (Spider-Man: Fake Red) will draw an adaptation of ""The Ninth Jedi"" in the August issue   Keisuke Sato (Little Witch Academia manga) will draw an adaptation of ""The Twins"" in the September issue    Star Wars: Visions is an anthology of nine animated shorts from Japanese creators and anime studios. Studios such as Trigger, Kinema Citrus, Kamikaze Douga, Science SARU, Production I.G, and Geno Studio produced the shorts. The anthology debuted on Disney+ in September 2021.    Ōsawa will also draw the manga adaptation of The Mandalorian.

Review   by Caitlin Moore, Apr 24th 2022       Muteking: The Dancing Hero 1-12 Streaming                     Synopsis:             The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.      Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes.

As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses.

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, Ghost Stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese Ghost Stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western Ghost Stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, Ghost Stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese Ghost Stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western Ghost Stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, Ghost Stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese Ghost Stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western Ghost Stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.
