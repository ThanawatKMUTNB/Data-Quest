Delicious Party Precure Episode 7  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 7 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.3            It's taken seven episodes and an unfortunate break, but at long last, the yellow Cure has made her appearance! As I've mentioned before, I do like that Delicious Party♡Precure has been taking its time in introducing the characters, and that holds true for Ran, Cure Yum-Yum's introduction. Ran is a force of nature, and bringing her in too early could have jeopardized Kokone's character development, not just because Ran dominates any scene she's in, but because her exuberance could have easily freaked poor Kokone right out and kept her in the background out of discomfort. As it stands, Kokone's had time to get used to Yui and Mari, and that goes a long way towards making her ready to not be completely overwhelmed by Ran. It shows good attention to the character dynamics of the team, and it also keeps Ran out of the main group long enough to have her encounter with the highly-suspicious student body president, who is almost certainly Gentlu or Secretoru in human guise. (I knew those gold sparkles on her head were suspicious.)    Having a human form certainly explains how Bundoru has been operating, too. Not that there's any law preventing nonhumans from using social media, but having one of them embedded in Oishi Na Town certainly helps facilitate their activities. It means that Bundoru's got a better idea of how human society works, which is how she knew which restaurants to target, much in the same way that Ran's social media posts lead Yui, Mari, and Kokone right to the ramen restaurant as the most likely place for Bundoru to hit. It's a nice way to show the Pretty Cure franchise keeping up with the times, and it also makes a lot of sense, taking the idea of influencer culture and using it naturally in the storyline. It also makes the villains look a little smarter and more worthy as foes; since both Bundoru and the Cures converged on Ran's family restaurant at the same time, it means they're on the same wavelength, which makes for a more equal, and therefore fraught, battle.    Not that Mari, Yui, and Kokone are looking all that good on the ol' intelligence meter this week after they figure out Ran's restaurant is the likely target. They somehow miss Mem-Mem's interest in Ran as a sign that she might be a Pretty Cure as well as her ability to see Recipepi as another marker of her likely transformation. Sure they might have other things on their minds, what with the much more powerful six Recipepi-powered Ubau-zo looming, but it still seems strikingly odd that they're surprised when Ran transforms into Cure Yum-Yum. Fortunately her day-saving tactics make up for that – Yum-Yum's base food is ramen, and that gives her whip-style weapons meant to mimic the long noodles. (Also her “noodle hands” pose works better than I was anticipating. I was having visions of wriggling fingers or something; the “noodles being poured” imagery of her upraised arm is much more pleasant.) This gives her a ranged attack that the other girls are missing, and the full complement of their skills make for a very solid set of powers that work well together. Even though they've only just banded together as a trio their teamwork is impressive; my only real issue is that I wasn't entirely sure how Yum-Yum's final attack actually hurt Ubau-zo.    Ran can be a lot to take, what with her high energy and Yum-Yum's very busy outfit, but I think she's going to solidify the team in a very powerful way. Mem-Mem's little Grumpy Cat mouth makes him the cutest of the fairies (in my opinion, but I may have a tiny dragon bias), and with the group in its first form assembled, things can start to heat up on the plot front. Step one may be figuring out how to take down the student body president. I'm looking forward to seeing how they pull that off.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 7  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 7 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.3            It's taken seven episodes and an unfortunate break, but at long last, the yellow Cure has made her appearance! As I've mentioned before, I do like that Delicious Party♡Precure has been taking its time in introducing the characters, and that holds true for Ran, Cure Yum-Yum's introduction. Ran is a force of nature, and bringing her in too early could have jeopardized Kokone's character development, not just because Ran dominates any scene she's in, but because her exuberance could have easily freaked poor Kokone right out and kept her in the background out of discomfort. As it stands, Kokone's had time to get used to Yui and Mari, and that goes a long way towards making her ready to not be completely overwhelmed by Ran. It shows good attention to the character dynamics of the team, and it also keeps Ran out of the main group long enough to have her encounter with the highly-suspicious student body president, who is almost certainly Gentlu or Secretoru in human guise. (I knew those gold sparkles on her head were suspicious.)    Having a human form certainly explains how Bundoru has been operating, too. Not that there's any law preventing nonhumans from using social media, but having one of them embedded in Oishi Na Town certainly helps facilitate their activities. It means that Bundoru's got a better idea of how human society works, which is how she knew which restaurants to target, much in the same way that Ran's social media posts lead Yui, Mari, and Kokone right to the ramen restaurant as the most likely place for Bundoru to hit. It's a nice way to show the Pretty Cure franchise keeping up with the times, and it also makes a lot of sense, taking the idea of influencer culture and using it naturally in the storyline. It also makes the villains look a little smarter and more worthy as foes; since both Bundoru and the Cures converged on Ran's family restaurant at the same time, it means they're on the same wavelength, which makes for a more equal, and therefore fraught, battle.    Not that Mari, Yui, and Kokone are looking all that good on the ol' intelligence meter this week after they figure out Ran's restaurant is the likely target. They somehow miss Mem-Mem's interest in Ran as a sign that she might be a Pretty Cure as well as her ability to see Recipepi as another marker of her likely transformation. Sure they might have other things on their minds, what with the much more powerful six Recipepi-powered Ubau-zo looming, but it still seems strikingly odd that they're surprised when Ran transforms into Cure Yum-Yum. Fortunately her day-saving tactics make up for that – Yum-Yum's base food is ramen, and that gives her whip-style weapons meant to mimic the long noodles. (Also her “noodle hands” pose works better than I was anticipating. I was having visions of wriggling fingers or something; the “noodles being poured” imagery of her upraised arm is much more pleasant.) This gives her a ranged attack that the other girls are missing, and the full complement of their skills make for a very solid set of powers that work well together. Even though they've only just banded together as a trio their teamwork is impressive; my only real issue is that I wasn't entirely sure how Yum-Yum's final attack actually hurt Ubau-zo.    Ran can be a lot to take, what with her high energy and Yum-Yum's very busy outfit, but I think she's going to solidify the team in a very powerful way. Mem-Mem's little Grumpy Cat mouth makes him the cutest of the fairies (in my opinion, but I may have a tiny dragon bias), and with the group in its first form assembled, things can start to heat up on the plot front. Step one may be figuring out how to take down the student body president. I'm looking forward to seeing how they pull that off.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 7  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 7 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.3            It's taken seven episodes and an unfortunate break, but at long last, the yellow Cure has made her appearance! As I've mentioned before, I do like that Delicious Party♡Precure has been taking its time in introducing the characters, and that holds true for Ran, Cure Yum-Yum's introduction. Ran is a force of nature, and bringing her in too early could have jeopardized Kokone's character development, not just because Ran dominates any scene she's in, but because her exuberance could have easily freaked poor Kokone right out and kept her in the background out of discomfort. As it stands, Kokone's had time to get used to Yui and Mari, and that goes a long way towards making her ready to not be completely overwhelmed by Ran. It shows good attention to the character dynamics of the team, and it also keeps Ran out of the main group long enough to have her encounter with the highly-suspicious student body president, who is almost certainly Gentlu or Secretoru in human guise. (I knew those gold sparkles on her head were suspicious.)    Having a human form certainly explains how Bundoru has been operating, too. Not that there's any law preventing nonhumans from using social media, but having one of them embedded in Oishi Na Town certainly helps facilitate their activities. It means that Bundoru's got a better idea of how human society works, which is how she knew which restaurants to target, much in the same way that Ran's social media posts lead Yui, Mari, and Kokone right to the ramen restaurant as the most likely place for Bundoru to hit. It's a nice way to show the Pretty Cure franchise keeping up with the times, and it also makes a lot of sense, taking the idea of influencer culture and using it naturally in the storyline. It also makes the villains look a little smarter and more worthy as foes; since both Bundoru and the Cures converged on Ran's family restaurant at the same time, it means they're on the same wavelength, which makes for a more equal, and therefore fraught, battle.    Not that Mari, Yui, and Kokone are looking all that good on the ol' intelligence meter this week after they figure out Ran's restaurant is the likely target. They somehow miss Mem-Mem's interest in Ran as a sign that she might be a Pretty Cure as well as her ability to see Recipepi as another marker of her likely transformation. Sure they might have other things on their minds, what with the much more powerful six Recipepi-powered Ubau-zo looming, but it still seems strikingly odd that they're surprised when Ran transforms into Cure Yum-Yum. Fortunately her day-saving tactics make up for that – Yum-Yum's base food is ramen, and that gives her whip-style weapons meant to mimic the long noodles. (Also her “noodle hands” pose works better than I was anticipating. I was having visions of wriggling fingers or something; the “noodles being poured” imagery of her upraised arm is much more pleasant.) This gives her a ranged attack that the other girls are missing, and the full complement of their skills make for a very solid set of powers that work well together. Even though they've only just banded together as a trio their teamwork is impressive; my only real issue is that I wasn't entirely sure how Yum-Yum's final attack actually hurt Ubau-zo.    Ran can be a lot to take, what with her high energy and Yum-Yum's very busy outfit, but I think she's going to solidify the team in a very powerful way. Mem-Mem's little Grumpy Cat mouth makes him the cutest of the fairies (in my opinion, but I may have a tiny dragon bias), and with the group in its first form assembled, things can start to heat up on the plot front. Step one may be figuring out how to take down the student body president. I'm looking forward to seeing how they pull that off.

News Sadako DX Film's Teaser Reveals More Cast   posted on 2022-04-26 08:52 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Kazuma Kawamura, Mario Kuroba, Yuki Yagi, Hiroyuki Watanabe, Naomi Nishida, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi join cast    The official website for Sadako DX, the new live-action film in the Ring franchise, unveiled a new teaser trailer, visual, and cast members on Tuesday.        The new cast members include: (Top row, left to right in image above)   Kazuma Kawamura as Ōji Maeda, a self-proclaimed fortune teller that accompanies Fuka in investigating Sadako's curse  Mario Kuroba as Maeda's assistant Lloyd Kanden   Yuki Yagi as Futaba Ichijō, Fuka's younger sister   Hiroyuki Watanabe as Ruma Tendō, Kenshin's father   (Bottom row, left to right in image above)   Naomi Nishida as Chieko Ichijō, Fuka's mother   Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Kenshin, a well-known spiritual medium that draws Fuka in by explaining Sadako's curse    As previously announced, Fūka Koshiba (pictured below) will star as Fuka Ichijo, a college student with 200 IQ who tries to unravel the curse of Sadako.     Hisashi Kimura is directing the film. Yūya Takahashi (Lupin the IIIrd: Fujiko Mine's Lie, Kamen Rider Ex-Aid) is writing the script. Filming has finished for the new movie, and it will open this fall.    Suzuki's Ring novel series inspired the horror franchise of the same name. The Japanese film series includes two timelines. The first film, Ring, debuted in 1998, and the Spiral sequel followed later that year. Ring 2 premiered in 1999, and Ring Ø: Birthday debuted in 2000. The franchise also includes two Sadako 3D films, as well as a new Sadako film, which opened in Japan in May 2019.    Distributor Arrow Video released The Ringu Collection Blu-ray Disc in North America in October 2019. The film collection includes Ring, Rasen (Spiral), Ring 2, and Ring Ø: Birthday. Arrow Video describes the story:   A group of teenage friends are found dead, their bodies grotesquely contorted, their faces twisted in terror. Reiko (Nanako Matsushima, When Marnie Was There), a journalist and the aunt of one of the victims, sets out to investigate the shocking phenomenon, and in the process uncovers a creepy urban legend about a supposedly cursed videotape, the contents of which causes anyone who views it to die within a week – unless they can persuade someone else to watch it, and, in so doing, pass on the curse…  The first main film received a Hollywood remake in 2002, and had two sequels. A new Hollywood film titled Rings opened in February 2017.    Additionally, the Japanese franchise includes the 2016 Sadako vs. Kayako crossover film with the Ju-on horror franchise.    Dark Horse has released some of the franchise's manga adaptations in English.

Reiko (Nanako Matsushima, When Marnie Was There), a journalist and the aunt of one of the victims, sets out to investigate the shocking phenomenon, and in the process uncovers a creepy urban legend about a supposedly cursed videotape, the contents of which causes anyone who views it to die within a week – unless they can persuade someone else to watch it, and, in so doing, pass on the curse…  The first main film received a Hollywood remake in 2002, and had two sequels. A new Hollywood film titled Rings opened in February 2017.    Additionally, the Japanese franchise includes the 2016 Sadako vs. Kayako crossover film with the Ju-on horror franchise.

News Sadako DX Film's Teaser Reveals More Cast   posted on 2022-04-26 08:52 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Kazuma Kawamura, Mario Kuroba, Yuki Yagi, Hiroyuki Watanabe, Naomi Nishida, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi join cast    The official website for Sadako DX, the new live-action film in the Ring franchise, unveiled a new teaser trailer, visual, and cast members on Tuesday.        The new cast members include: (Top row, left to right in image above)   Kazuma Kawamura as Ōji Maeda, a self-proclaimed fortune teller that accompanies Fuka in investigating Sadako's curse  Mario Kuroba as Maeda's assistant Lloyd Kanden   Yuki Yagi as Futaba Ichijō, Fuka's younger sister   Hiroyuki Watanabe as Ruma Tendō, Kenshin's father   (Bottom row, left to right in image above)   Naomi Nishida as Chieko Ichijō, Fuka's mother   Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Kenshin, a well-known spiritual medium that draws Fuka in by explaining Sadako's curse    As previously announced, Fūka Koshiba (pictured below) will star as Fuka Ichijo, a college student with 200 IQ who tries to unravel the curse of Sadako.     Hisashi Kimura is directing the film. Yūya Takahashi (Lupin the IIIrd: Fujiko Mine's Lie, Kamen Rider Ex-Aid) is writing the script. Filming has finished for the new movie, and it will open this fall.    Suzuki's Ring novel series inspired the horror franchise of the same name. The Japanese film series includes two timelines. The first film, Ring, debuted in 1998, and the Spiral sequel followed later that year. Ring 2 premiered in 1999, and Ring Ø: Birthday debuted in 2000. The franchise also includes two Sadako 3D films, as well as a new Sadako film, which opened in Japan in May 2019.    Distributor Arrow Video released The Ringu Collection Blu-ray Disc in North America in October 2019. The film collection includes Ring, Rasen (Spiral), Ring 2, and Ring Ø: Birthday. Arrow Video describes the story:   A group of teenage friends are found dead, their bodies grotesquely contorted, their faces twisted in terror. Reiko (Nanako Matsushima, When Marnie Was There), a journalist and the aunt of one of the victims, sets out to investigate the shocking phenomenon, and in the process uncovers a creepy urban legend about a supposedly cursed videotape, the contents of which causes anyone who views it to die within a week – unless they can persuade someone else to watch it, and, in so doing, pass on the curse…  The first main film received a Hollywood remake in 2002, and had two sequels. A new Hollywood film titled Rings opened in February 2017.    Additionally, the Japanese franchise includes the 2016 Sadako vs. Kayako crossover film with the Ju-on horror franchise.    Dark Horse has released some of the franchise's manga adaptations in English.
