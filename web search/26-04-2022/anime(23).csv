The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in.

So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series?

But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.

But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable.

Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping.

Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations.

It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations.

Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict.

Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog.

Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate.

The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs.

26-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-22/paranoia-agent-how-does-it-hold-up/.184902,Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up? - Anime News Network:SEA,"   Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point.

Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations.

Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him.

JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.

Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters.

Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V.

Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb.

The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle.

I'm Quitting Heroing Episodes 1-3  by Grant Jones, Apr 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            I'm Quitting Heroing presents an interesting twist to the standard adventuring hero formula. Our lead Leo is a powerful warrior and spellcaster who, after defeating the demon queen Echidna, didn't receive the warm welcome he had anticipated. Instead, he gets run out of town and there are even assassins sent out after him. Now he is applying to be a part of the demon queen's army – that is, if he can get past the interview step.    The premiere mostly centers around Leo and the four generals of Echidna's demon army. We get a bit of background from each of them and how they are defeated by Leo, as well as a few flashbacks to Leo's adventuring life and what brought him to this point. In the end, the generals agree that he might be able to help revitalize the demon army and get things back on track, and decided to put in a good word for him.    I'm mixed on this first episode. On the one hand, I'm glad we're in an actual fantasy world and not an isekai situation (so far as I am aware), which is a nice change of pace. The comedy is pretty solid and gave me more than a few chuckles throughout his episode. The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights. Similarly, the animation is perfectly fine and the character designs are varied enough to be interesting.    There are a few stumbling blocks though. Leo is very self-absorbed and the “I am so amazing why is everyone else so terrible” setup around him is… not exactly framed as a flaw. Hopefully this ends up being something he has to overcome or grow away from in the future, because otherwise, this episode is almost entirely about how great Leo is and everyone basically agreeing that yes, Leo is indeed great (except for the people of the kingdom who did not like him because he was just too great at demon-slaying).  I also am not a huge fan of Lily and the sequences involving her.    Here's hoping the show leans into the stronger comedy going forward.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 2 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.    The real meat of the episode was about prioritization and efficiency in kingdom management. Leo spends most of the episode helping Shutina bring the mana reactors for the fortress back online, alongside other administrative tasks. The idea about the recharging talisman and a work crew to keep them rolling is, well, pretty basic division of labor stuff. I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication. We'll see if they stick with that in future episodes.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 3 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            Hey, this Lily episode surprisingly turned out pretty all right. There were a few undertones that I could do without, but overall it had a good heart and *gasp* a lesson for Leo.    The island setting is an interesting change from our previous generic fantasy locale.  Leo standing on the beach in full edgelord armor makes for a pretty funny image, whether it was meant to be or not. The general vibe of the episode is also good, with everyone working together and Leo being a bit out of his depth.    The comedic hook of the episode's plot has to do with Leo challenging Lily to help her mature. Leo is clearly underestimating Lily, and watching her upend his expectations at every instance, whether due to her innate power from her Fenrir form or her general resourcefulness, is such a great payoff. By the end of the episode, Leo even admits that he misjudged her and went through a whole lot of nonsense when he could have just communicated with her. The entire segment functions as both a great comedic highlight and a good lesson for our hero! Leo concocting these elaborate goofball scenarios all because he doesn't think he can just speak to Lily is something that he does need to learn and grow from.    The lore behind the island chains was a bit of a mess. It was clearly just meant to be a place for lots of Adventure™ but I'm not sure the descriptions meshed all that well. It's supposed to be an unexplored mystery, but if that's the case, why are there countless shipwrecks and entire island populations existing and thriving? Furthermore, this particular island is so well-known to the demon queen's forces that they had pre-existing trade relations with them – relations so vital they can't possible do without them. This also makes the entire crux of last episode about the lack of delegation feel like that much more of a head-scratcher: how exactly is all of this international trade happening without at least some robust logistical structure? But maybe that's analyzing the show too much.    Side note: I think Lily's adorable little drawings are great. Seeing all the happy little monsters cheering is Good Art as far as I'm concerned.

I'm Quitting Heroing Episodes 1-3  by Grant Jones, Apr 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            I'm Quitting Heroing presents an interesting twist to the standard adventuring hero formula. Our lead Leo is a powerful warrior and spellcaster who, after defeating the demon queen Echidna, didn't receive the warm welcome he had anticipated. Instead, he gets run out of town and there are even assassins sent out after him. Now he is applying to be a part of the demon queen's army – that is, if he can get past the interview step.    The premiere mostly centers around Leo and the four generals of Echidna's demon army. We get a bit of background from each of them and how they are defeated by Leo, as well as a few flashbacks to Leo's adventuring life and what brought him to this point. In the end, the generals agree that he might be able to help revitalize the demon army and get things back on track, and decided to put in a good word for him.    I'm mixed on this first episode. On the one hand, I'm glad we're in an actual fantasy world and not an isekai situation (so far as I am aware), which is a nice change of pace. The comedy is pretty solid and gave me more than a few chuckles throughout his episode. The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights. Similarly, the animation is perfectly fine and the character designs are varied enough to be interesting.    There are a few stumbling blocks though. Leo is very self-absorbed and the “I am so amazing why is everyone else so terrible” setup around him is… not exactly framed as a flaw. Hopefully this ends up being something he has to overcome or grow away from in the future, because otherwise, this episode is almost entirely about how great Leo is and everyone basically agreeing that yes, Leo is indeed great (except for the people of the kingdom who did not like him because he was just too great at demon-slaying).  I also am not a huge fan of Lily and the sequences involving her.    Here's hoping the show leans into the stronger comedy going forward.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 2 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.    The real meat of the episode was about prioritization and efficiency in kingdom management. Leo spends most of the episode helping Shutina bring the mana reactors for the fortress back online, alongside other administrative tasks. The idea about the recharging talisman and a work crew to keep them rolling is, well, pretty basic division of labor stuff. I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication. We'll see if they stick with that in future episodes.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 3 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            Hey, this Lily episode surprisingly turned out pretty all right. There were a few undertones that I could do without, but overall it had a good heart and *gasp* a lesson for Leo.    The island setting is an interesting change from our previous generic fantasy locale.  Leo standing on the beach in full edgelord armor makes for a pretty funny image, whether it was meant to be or not. The general vibe of the episode is also good, with everyone working together and Leo being a bit out of his depth.    The comedic hook of the episode's plot has to do with Leo challenging Lily to help her mature. Leo is clearly underestimating Lily, and watching her upend his expectations at every instance, whether due to her innate power from her Fenrir form or her general resourcefulness, is such a great payoff. By the end of the episode, Leo even admits that he misjudged her and went through a whole lot of nonsense when he could have just communicated with her. The entire segment functions as both a great comedic highlight and a good lesson for our hero! Leo concocting these elaborate goofball scenarios all because he doesn't think he can just speak to Lily is something that he does need to learn and grow from.    The lore behind the island chains was a bit of a mess. It was clearly just meant to be a place for lots of Adventure™ but I'm not sure the descriptions meshed all that well. It's supposed to be an unexplored mystery, but if that's the case, why are there countless shipwrecks and entire island populations existing and thriving? Furthermore, this particular island is so well-known to the demon queen's forces that they had pre-existing trade relations with them – relations so vital they can't possible do without them. This also makes the entire crux of last episode about the lack of delegation feel like that much more of a head-scratcher: how exactly is all of this international trade happening without at least some robust logistical structure? But maybe that's analyzing the show too much.    Side note: I think Lily's adorable little drawings are great. Seeing all the happy little monsters cheering is Good Art as far as I'm concerned.

The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights. Similarly, the animation is perfectly fine and the character designs are varied enough to be interesting.    There are a few stumbling blocks though. Leo is very self-absorbed and the “I am so amazing why is everyone else so terrible” setup around him is… not exactly framed as a flaw. Hopefully this ends up being something he has to overcome or grow away from in the future, because otherwise, this episode is almost entirely about how great Leo is and everyone basically agreeing that yes, Leo is indeed great (except for the people of the kingdom who did not like him because he was just too great at demon-slaying).  I also am not a huge fan of Lily and the sequences involving her.    Here's hoping the show leans into the stronger comedy going forward.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 2 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.    The real meat of the episode was about prioritization and efficiency in kingdom management. Leo spends most of the episode helping Shutina bring the mana reactors for the fortress back online, alongside other administrative tasks. The idea about the recharging talisman and a work crew to keep them rolling is, well, pretty basic division of labor stuff. I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication. We'll see if they stick with that in future episodes.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 3 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            Hey, this Lily episode surprisingly turned out pretty all right. There were a few undertones that I could do without, but overall it had a good heart and *gasp* a lesson for Leo.    The island setting is an interesting change from our previous generic fantasy locale.  Leo standing on the beach in full edgelord armor makes for a pretty funny image, whether it was meant to be or not. The general vibe of the episode is also good, with everyone working together and Leo being a bit out of his depth.    The comedic hook of the episode's plot has to do with Leo challenging Lily to help her mature. Leo is clearly underestimating Lily, and watching her upend his expectations at every instance, whether due to her innate power from her Fenrir form or her general resourcefulness, is such a great payoff. By the end of the episode, Leo even admits that he misjudged her and went through a whole lot of nonsense when he could have just communicated with her. The entire segment functions as both a great comedic highlight and a good lesson for our hero! Leo concocting these elaborate goofball scenarios all because he doesn't think he can just speak to Lily is something that he does need to learn and grow from.    The lore behind the island chains was a bit of a mess. It was clearly just meant to be a place for lots of Adventure™ but I'm not sure the descriptions meshed all that well. It's supposed to be an unexplored mystery, but if that's the case, why are there countless shipwrecks and entire island populations existing and thriving? Furthermore, this particular island is so well-known to the demon queen's forces that they had pre-existing trade relations with them – relations so vital they can't possible do without them. This also makes the entire crux of last episode about the lack of delegation feel like that much more of a head-scratcher: how exactly is all of this international trade happening without at least some robust logistical structure? But maybe that's analyzing the show too much.    Side note: I think Lily's adorable little drawings are great. Seeing all the happy little monsters cheering is Good Art as far as I'm concerned.

I'm Quitting Heroing Episodes 1-3  by Grant Jones, Apr 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            I'm Quitting Heroing presents an interesting twist to the standard adventuring hero formula. Our lead Leo is a powerful warrior and spellcaster who, after defeating the demon queen Echidna, didn't receive the warm welcome he had anticipated. Instead, he gets run out of town and there are even assassins sent out after him. Now he is applying to be a part of the demon queen's army – that is, if he can get past the interview step.    The premiere mostly centers around Leo and the four generals of Echidna's demon army. We get a bit of background from each of them and how they are defeated by Leo, as well as a few flashbacks to Leo's adventuring life and what brought him to this point. In the end, the generals agree that he might be able to help revitalize the demon army and get things back on track, and decided to put in a good word for him.    I'm mixed on this first episode. On the one hand, I'm glad we're in an actual fantasy world and not an isekai situation (so far as I am aware), which is a nice change of pace. The comedy is pretty solid and gave me more than a few chuckles throughout his episode. The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights.

News Toei Animation Establishes Animator Training Program   posted on 2022-04-26 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Program starts in April 2023    Toei Animation announced on Wednesday that it is establishing ""Toei Animation Sakuga Academy,"" an animator training program, in April 2023. It is a one-year, short-term intensive, and practical animator training program in which experienced animators guide up-and-coming trainees. Following the training and an examination, successful students will be hired as contract workers for Toei Animation. Recruitment is open.    Atsutoshi Umezawa (One Piece, Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F', Sailor Moon Crystal, Digimon Tamers) is the program director. Lecturers are from Toei Animation and Studio Live, and they include Takeo Ide (Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Dragon Ball Super), Hiroshi Koujina (Hunter × Hunter 2011, City Hunter '91), Nishiki Itaoka (Smile Precure!), Mai Ishii (Ushio & Tora, Hunter × Hunter 2011), and Mayuko Nakano (WWW.WAGNARIA!!, The Vampire Dies in No Time).    The program consists of three months of video training, followed by a nine-month animation or digital video course, depending on the aspirations of each student. The program will accept about 10 participants. Toei Animation will handle the tuition costs and will also offer 150,000 yen (about US$1.170) per month to students.    In previous years, Toei has trained animators in-house by hiring new graduates.

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is real golf. I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is real golf. I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is real golf. I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible.

If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.

That actually happened to me ...                    column          14 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!
