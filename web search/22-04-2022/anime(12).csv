Look if it was free with ads it might work, but at that point i might as well watch TV.    No the real issue here is the rampant dilution of good shows on streaming platforms as everyone and their cousin starts their own streaming business thinking it is a good idea.    All this is going to achieve is more and more people dusting off the old hat and eyepatch.

Yeah I was gonna say, most people I know have the ad supported tier of Hulu solely because it's cheaper and it's clearly working for the company      Back to top                  Generations    Joined: 21 Jul 2016 		    Posts: 173       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 2:45 am            I can't wait for companies to abuse this trend and have ads playing regardless of your 'tier'.

But also, yeah, ad-supported streaming tiers clearly work. I had Hulu for about a year with ads, and it worked fine because 1) it was significantly cheaper than the without-ads tear (like $7/month compared to $13/month), 2) the ads were still shorter than actual commercials, and 3) they didn't have any ads in the middle of movies, only TV shows. If Netflix decides to do the same thing, especially if the cost is right, I might just change my subscription tier, especially if the anti-account sharing thing becomes widespread.

Most services don't do binge releases, and that is the bigger problem for Netflix with churn now. It's just too easy to sign up, binge the one show you really want, and cancel.   Their content library isn't that great, either; they're fairly poor on having a collection of classic rewatchable movies, and they don't have the best quality in new shows either. Losing the older Marvel shows doesn't help, along with other things that they've lost to original content owners. They're good for ""I am bored and want something in the background while glancing at my phone,"" but a lot is forgettable popcorn content at best. (An exception that proves the rule - they're spacing the new Stranger Things season over two months.)   All that said, they still have a ton of subscribers, which is part of the problem; they are not nearly so dominant in anything to justify such dominant subscriber numbers, so it's hard to hold onto people as normal churn occurs.[/quote]      Back to top                  Kadmos1    Joined: 08 May 2014 		    Posts: 13259 		    Location: In Phoenix but has an 85308 ZIP 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 9:46 am            In the case of Hulu, I still think that they should have not had ads at all unless it was a person watching the title without being a paying subscriber. However, Hulu being arguably a smaller platform paying subscriber count wise might justify them using ads. Same could apply to HBO Max.   In terms of having ads, if Netflix opted for the ""Skip Ads"" feature that YT offers, then I think some subscribers might tolerate the ad tier version more.

Netflix lost focus and used the loss of customers as an excuse to give this as an option, despite one of the major reasons why people cancelled being that many people believe that the pandemic is currently subsiding. With this, these people are able to experience other activities aside from watching Netflix.    You could call this the bubble that was going to burst at one point or another regardless of Netflix's content or choices. Outside factors are playing a major point in Netflix's customer behavior.   Netflix might be able to keep or regain customers with their lower plan with ads, but I don't think it will be enough. I don't believe those numbers will not return unless the pandemic elevates again or another thing arises that makes people unable or unwilling to leave their residence.

On the other hand, it's very much likely they're getting some of those subscribers back with this idea of an ad-tier plan, so it's might as well work in their favor and empower them even more to keep doing their bussiness practices. If it has worked with Hulu, it will work for them.   Either way, paying a subscripcion service for shitty quality seems like a waste of money, with or without ads.

I guess you don't watch Netflix content then, you know, since they have like 3 good shows and one good movie of the almost 20+ titles they throw up at a year. Nad that's not even mentioning the ones that they cancel after one of two good seasons.  ""What makes their quality ""not good""?"" I don't know dude, go watch it.

Look if it was free with ads it might work, but at that point i might as well watch TV.    No the real issue here is the rampant dilution of good shows on streaming platforms as everyone and their cousin starts their own streaming business thinking it is a good idea.    All this is going to achieve is more and more people dusting off the old hat and eyepatch.

But also, yeah, ad-supported streaming tiers clearly work. I had Hulu for about a year with ads, and it worked fine because 1) it was significantly cheaper than the without-ads tear (like $7/month compared to $13/month), 2) the ads were still shorter than actual commercials, and 3) they didn't have any ads in the middle of movies, only TV shows. If Netflix decides to do the same thing, especially if the cost is right, I might just change my subscription tier, especially if the anti-account sharing thing becomes widespread.

Most services don't do binge releases, and that is the bigger problem for Netflix with churn now. It's just too easy to sign up, binge the one show you really want, and cancel.   Their content library isn't that great, either; they're fairly poor on having a collection of classic rewatchable movies, and they don't have the best quality in new shows either. Losing the older Marvel shows doesn't help, along with other things that they've lost to original content owners. They're good for ""I am bored and want something in the background while glancing at my phone,"" but a lot is forgettable popcorn content at best. (An exception that proves the rule - they're spacing the new Stranger Things season over two months.)   All that said, they still have a ton of subscribers, which is part of the problem; they are not nearly so dominant in anything to justify such dominant subscriber numbers, so it's hard to hold onto people as normal churn occurs.[/quote]      Back to top                  Kadmos1    Joined: 08 May 2014 		    Posts: 13259 		    Location: In Phoenix but has an 85308 ZIP 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 9:46 am            In the case of Hulu, I still think that they should have not had ads at all unless it was a person watching the title without being a paying subscriber. However, Hulu being arguably a smaller platform paying subscriber count wise might justify them using ads. Same could apply to HBO Max.   In terms of having ads, if Netflix opted for the ""Skip Ads"" feature that YT offers, then I think some subscribers might tolerate the ad tier version more.

Netflix lost focus and used the loss of customers as an excuse to give this as an option, despite one of the major reasons why people cancelled being that many people believe that the pandemic is currently subsiding. With this, these people are able to experience other activities aside from watching Netflix.    You could call this the bubble that was going to burst at one point or another regardless of Netflix's content or choices. Outside factors are playing a major point in Netflix's customer behavior.   Netflix might be able to keep or regain customers with their lower plan with ads, but I don't think it will be enough. I don't believe those numbers will not return unless the pandemic elevates again or another thing arises that makes people unable or unwilling to leave their residence.

On the other hand, it's very much likely they're getting some of those subscribers back with this idea of an ad-tier plan, so it's might as well work in their favor and empower them even more to keep doing their bussiness practices. If it has worked with Hulu, it will work for them.   Either way, paying a subscripcion service for shitty quality seems like a waste of money, with or without ads.

I guess you don't watch Netflix content then, you know, since they have like 3 good shows and one good movie of the almost 20+ titles they throw up at a year. Nad that's not even mentioning the ones that they cancel after one of two good seasons.  ""What makes their quality ""not good""?"" I don't know dude, go watch it.

Look if it was free with ads it might work, but at that point i might as well watch TV.    No the real issue here is the rampant dilution of good shows on streaming platforms as everyone and their cousin starts their own streaming business thinking it is a good idea.    All this is going to achieve is more and more people dusting off the old hat and eyepatch.

But also, yeah, ad-supported streaming tiers clearly work. I had Hulu for about a year with ads, and it worked fine because 1) it was significantly cheaper than the without-ads tear (like $7/month compared to $13/month), 2) the ads were still shorter than actual commercials, and 3) they didn't have any ads in the middle of movies, only TV shows. If Netflix decides to do the same thing, especially if the cost is right, I might just change my subscription tier, especially if the anti-account sharing thing becomes widespread.

Most services don't do binge releases, and that is the bigger problem for Netflix with churn now. It's just too easy to sign up, binge the one show you really want, and cancel.   Their content library isn't that great, either; they're fairly poor on having a collection of classic rewatchable movies, and they don't have the best quality in new shows either. Losing the older Marvel shows doesn't help, along with other things that they've lost to original content owners. They're good for ""I am bored and want something in the background while glancing at my phone,"" but a lot is forgettable popcorn content at best. (An exception that proves the rule - they're spacing the new Stranger Things season over two months.)   All that said, they still have a ton of subscribers, which is part of the problem; they are not nearly so dominant in anything to justify such dominant subscriber numbers, so it's hard to hold onto people as normal churn occurs.[/quote]      Back to top                  Kadmos1    Joined: 08 May 2014 		    Posts: 13259 		    Location: In Phoenix but has an 85308 ZIP 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 9:46 am            In the case of Hulu, I still think that they should have not had ads at all unless it was a person watching the title without being a paying subscriber. However, Hulu being arguably a smaller platform paying subscriber count wise might justify them using ads. Same could apply to HBO Max.   In terms of having ads, if Netflix opted for the ""Skip Ads"" feature that YT offers, then I think some subscribers might tolerate the ad tier version more.

Netflix lost focus and used the loss of customers as an excuse to give this as an option, despite one of the major reasons why people cancelled being that many people believe that the pandemic is currently subsiding. With this, these people are able to experience other activities aside from watching Netflix.    You could call this the bubble that was going to burst at one point or another regardless of Netflix's content or choices. Outside factors are playing a major point in Netflix's customer behavior.   Netflix might be able to keep or regain customers with their lower plan with ads, but I don't think it will be enough. I don't believe those numbers will not return unless the pandemic elevates again or another thing arises that makes people unable or unwilling to leave their residence.

On the other hand, it's very much likely they're getting some of those subscribers back with this idea of an ad-tier plan, so it's might as well work in their favor and empower them even more to keep doing their bussiness practices. If it has worked with Hulu, it will work for them.   Either way, paying a subscripcion service for shitty quality seems like a waste of money, with or without ads.

I guess you don't watch Netflix content then, you know, since they have like 3 good shows and one good movie of the almost 20+ titles they throw up at a year. Nad that's not even mentioning the ones that they cancel after one of two good seasons.  ""What makes their quality ""not good""?"" I don't know dude, go watch it.

Look if it was free with ads it might work, but at that point i might as well watch TV.    No the real issue here is the rampant dilution of good shows on streaming platforms as everyone and their cousin starts their own streaming business thinking it is a good idea.

But also, yeah, ad-supported streaming tiers clearly work. I had Hulu for about a year with ads, and it worked fine because 1) it was significantly cheaper than the without-ads tear (like $7/month compared to $13/month), 2) the ads were still shorter than actual commercials, and 3) they didn't have any ads in the middle of movies, only TV shows. If Netflix decides to do the same thing, especially if the cost is right, I might just change my subscription tier, especially if the anti-account sharing thing becomes widespread.

Most services don't do binge releases, and that is the bigger problem for Netflix with churn now. It's just too easy to sign up, binge the one show you really want, and cancel.   Their content library isn't that great, either; they're fairly poor on having a collection of classic rewatchable movies, and they don't have the best quality in new shows either. Losing the older Marvel shows doesn't help, along with other things that they've lost to original content owners. They're good for ""I am bored and want something in the background while glancing at my phone,"" but a lot is forgettable popcorn content at best. (An exception that proves the rule - they're spacing the new Stranger Things season over two months.)   All that said, they still have a ton of subscribers, which is part of the problem; they are not nearly so dominant in anything to justify such dominant subscriber numbers, so it's hard to hold onto people as normal churn occurs.[/quote]      Back to top                  Kadmos1    Joined: 08 May 2014 		    Posts: 13259 		    Location: In Phoenix but has an 85308 ZIP 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 9:46 am            In the case of Hulu, I still think that they should have not had ads at all unless it was a person watching the title without being a paying subscriber. However, Hulu being arguably a smaller platform paying subscriber count wise might justify them using ads. Same could apply to HBO Max.   In terms of having ads, if Netflix opted for the ""Skip Ads"" feature that YT offers, then I think some subscribers might tolerate the ad tier version more.

Netflix lost focus and used the loss of customers as an excuse to give this as an option, despite one of the major reasons why people cancelled being that many people believe that the pandemic is currently subsiding. With this, these people are able to experience other activities aside from watching Netflix.    You could call this the bubble that was going to burst at one point or another regardless of Netflix's content or choices. Outside factors are playing a major point in Netflix's customer behavior.   Netflix might be able to keep or regain customers with their lower plan with ads, but I don't think it will be enough. I don't believe those numbers will not return unless the pandemic elevates again or another thing arises that makes people unable or unwilling to leave their residence.

On the other hand, it's very much likely they're getting some of those subscribers back with this idea of an ad-tier plan, so it's might as well work in their favor and empower them even more to keep doing their bussiness practices. If it has worked with Hulu, it will work for them.   Either way, paying a subscripcion service for shitty quality seems like a waste of money, with or without ads.

I guess you don't watch Netflix content then, you know, since they have like 3 good shows and one good movie of the almost 20+ titles they throw up at a year. Nad that's not even mentioning the ones that they cancel after one of two good seasons.  ""What makes their quality ""not good""?"" I don't know dude, go watch it.

News Bubble Anime Film's Trailer Previews Eve's Opening Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-20 23:14 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film debuts worldwide on Netflix on April 28, opens in Japanese theaters on May 13    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming a new trailer on Thursday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio, on Thursday. The video previews Eve's newly created opening theme song ""Bubble feat. Uta.""      The song launches on Thursday.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.      Singer-songwriter Riria. performs the ending theme song ""Jaa ne, Mata ne."" (See You, Catch You Later.) ""Riria."" (written with a period.) gained fans when she began posting songs on TikTok and YouTube without revealing her face in the fall of 2019, and she has since garnered over 1.7 million followers across several social media platforms. She is not only singing the ending theme song but also voicing the heroine Uta. This is the first voice-acting role for Rina., who was personally requested by director Tetsuro Araki and producer Genki Kawamura.    In 2018, Netfix announced a comprehensive business alliance with Production I.G and BONES on Wednesday. The alliance includes both Production I.G and its sister anime studio in the IG Port group, Wit Studio. Wit Studio is also producing the original anime Vampire in the Garden, which will debut in Netflix on May 16.    Sources: Warner Bros.

News Bubble Anime Film's Trailer Previews Eve's Opening Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-20 23:14 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film debuts worldwide on Netflix on April 28, opens in Japanese theaters on May 13    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming a new trailer on Thursday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio, on Thursday. The video previews Eve's newly created opening theme song ""Bubble feat. Uta.""      The song launches on Thursday.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.      Singer-songwriter Riria. performs the ending theme song ""Jaa ne, Mata ne."" (See You, Catch You Later.) ""Riria."" (written with a period.) gained fans when she began posting songs on TikTok and YouTube without revealing her face in the fall of 2019, and she has since garnered over 1.7 million followers across several social media platforms. She is not only singing the ending theme song but also voicing the heroine Uta. This is the first voice-acting role for Rina., who was personally requested by director Tetsuro Araki and producer Genki Kawamura.    In 2018, Netfix announced a comprehensive business alliance with Production I.G and BONES on Wednesday. The alliance includes both Production I.G and its sister anime studio in the IG Port group, Wit Studio. Wit Studio is also producing the original anime Vampire in the Garden, which will debut in Netflix on May 16.    Sources: Warner Bros.

Uta.""      The song launches on Thursday.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End).

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (299 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (299 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right?

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (299 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right?

At least mashing the refresh button on your browser is more civilized than spending hours in ...                    column          16 comments       Shelf Life - Persona 4: The Animation   2017 Nov 21, 00:00 16 comments                 anime    Gabriella revisits the anime adaptation of this hit JRPG to see if it's worth watching on its own merits, while Paul runs down all this week's new releases along with a new king-sized Shelf Obsessed! ―  Since in-game purchases seem to be a hot topic in the video game world these days, I figured I'd offer up a potentially obvious piece of advice as someone who's bought and collected all kinds of junk ...                    column          10 comments       Shelf Life - The Amagami SS Collection   2017 Nov 14, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    James checks out both seasons of Amagami SS plus the OVAs to see if this girlfriend-swapping romance is worth watching.

That actually happened to me ...                    column          14 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!

Luckily for me, I'm well practiced in the art of not making snark...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line part 2   2019 Apr 30, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella reviews the final chapter of this wild gothic horror road trip on blu-ray, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Ace Combat game on sale last week, and despite not having played anything in that genre since the previous console generation, I'm actually still decent at flying an imaginary plane.

I'm taking a break this season, but the rest of the crew has all this season's new shows covered.

Not because I don't already have a huge gaming backlog to deal with, but because I need an excuse to finally take a break from the Fate smartphone game.

The Quintessential Quintuplets is proving that an old-fashioned harem comedy can still be entertaining, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is excellent across the board, and I guess Domestic Girlfri...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Urahara   2019 Feb 26, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes a look at an underrated magical girl show that takes place in the streets of Harajuku, while Paul runs down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  Ever wake up on a Saturday and realize the last seven days have all been a blur?

I can already tell I'm going to go back through this show a second or thi...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - King's Game   2019 Feb 12, 06:31 8 comments                 anime    Paul subjects himself to one of the most hilariously bad entries in survival game horror, along with all this week's new blu-ray releases. ―  I've had all kinds of problems getting my anime streaming apps to work lately, but at least this has given me an excuse to binge some nature documentaries.

It's a nice little sports story with less of the typical teenage drama, and there's something wonderfully indulgent abo...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Hells   2019 Jan 22, 03:15 9 comments                 anime    Paul takes a look at Madhouse's avant-garde movie about the underworld with a dub produced by Youtubers, plus a brand-new Shelf Obsessed submission and all this week's new anime releases! ―  By the time you read this, I'll probably be digging out from a foot or more of snow.

I'll be taking next week off, so you won't see a new column on the 24th (don't worry, nothing's coming out that week anyway).

It's one of those stories that manages to be about children without being exclusively for children. If it's playing in your area, you m...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!

It's a delightfully twisted little comedy, a fun send-up of both zombie and idol shows. I know that sounds insane, but it works better than it sounds. Welcome to Shelf Life.

If you skipped over Revue Starlight or Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san whe...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - Kokkoku   2019 May  7, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this time-stopping supernatural thriller and breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  We're coming up on the season for final exams, and for those of us who work in college libraries, that means interacting with a lot of panicked undergrads who haven't set foot in a library since their first tour of the campus. Luckily for me, I'm well practiced in the art of not making snark...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line part 2   2019 Apr 30, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella reviews the final chapter of this wild gothic horror road trip on blu-ray, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Ace Combat game on sale last week, and despite not having played anything in that genre since the previous console generation, I'm actually still decent at flying an imaginary plane.

There is not enough caffeine in the world to overcome the crushing realization of ""I was just here a few ...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Galaxy Express 999: The Movie   2019 Apr  9, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this Leiji Matsumoto classic on blu-ray and breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  Hey, it's Preview Guide time again! I'm taking a break this season, but the rest of the crew has all this season's new shows covered. I'm expecting the new Fruits Basket adaptation to be the big show this time around, but you never know when some obscure series is going to come out of nowhere a...                    column          6 comments       Shelf Life - Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru Season 2   2019 Apr  2, 02:00 6 comments                 anime    Paul takes on a whole warehouse full of historical sword boys in the second season of Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru, plus all of this week's new anime bluray releases! ―  To follow up on my intro from a couple weeks ago, I did buy the new Fate video game, and it had the desired effect of finally pulling me away from the mobile game. My login streak remains unbroken, though, because you can't not keep up you...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Mitsuboshi Colors   2019 Mar 26, 00:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul snuggles up with an adorable slice-of-life series about mischievous ragamuffins and breaks down this week's huge slate of new blu-ray releases! ―  The good news: Cells at Work is getting a second season!

Not because I don't already have a huge gaming backlog to deal with, but because I need an excuse to finally take a break from the Fate smartphone game. A pers...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line   2019 Mar 12, 00:00 12 comments                 anime    The Golden Armor returns once more for the wildly entertaining Garo: Vanishing Line part 1. Plus: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I lent my copy of the Tomorrow's Joe movie to a friend months ago, and he still hasn't watched it, let alone returned it. This is fine, however, because watching him confess his crushing guilt on a weekly basis is providing me with more entertainment...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Just Because!   2019 Mar  5, 02:00 9 comments                 anime    James dives into the turbulent waters of mushy teen romance with this curiously named series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  This season is shaping up to be a good one for comedies. The Quintessential Quintuplets is proving that an old-fashioned harem comedy can still be entertaining, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is excellent across the board, and I guess Domestic Girlfri...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Urahara   2019 Feb 26, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes a look at an underrated magical girl show that takes place in the streets of Harajuku, while Paul runs down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  Ever wake up on a Saturday and realize the last seven days have all been a blur? That happened to me this week.

I can already tell I'm going to go back through this show a second or thi...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - King's Game   2019 Feb 12, 06:31 8 comments                 anime    Paul subjects himself to one of the most hilariously bad entries in survival game horror, along with all this week's new blu-ray releases. ―  I've had all kinds of problems getting my anime streaming apps to work lately, but at least this has given me an excuse to binge some nature documentaries. And yes, I absolutely make up obnoxious dialogue for the animals on screen, because that's the only corre...                    column          26 comments       Shelf Life - My Girlfriend is Shobitch   2019 Feb  5, 04:00 26 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes on a particularly stiff and seemingly already forgotten comedy about sexually clueless teens - plus all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  Collecting things can be a strange process, especially when you look at it from an outsider's perspective. I recently tried to explain to someone why, when faced with a choice between two video games, I bought the one that cost more...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - Girls' Last Tour   2019 Jan 29, 02:00 20 comments                 anime    Paul discovers the world's most heartwarming apocalypse anime and breaks down all this week's new anime Blu-ray releases! ―  I can already sense my hopes of staying current with this season's simulcasts slipping away, but one series I've managed to keep up with is Run With the Wind. It's a nice little sports story with less of the typical teenage drama, and there's something wonderfully indulgent abo...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Hells   2019 Jan 22, 03:15 9 comments                 anime    Paul takes a look at Madhouse's avant-garde movie about the underworld with a dub produced by Youtubers, plus a brand-new Shelf Obsessed submission and all this week's new anime releases! ―  By the time you read this, I'll probably be digging out from a foot or more of snow.

I'll be taking next week off, so you won't see a new column on the 24th (don't worry, nothing's coming out that week anyway). We'll be back with a ""year in review""...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - UQ Holder!   2018 Dec 11, 01:00 20 comments                 anime    Gabriella plunges deep into the lore of Ken Akamatsu for this Negima! spinoff action series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Super Smash Bros. game this week, only to re-discover that I'm not very good at Smash games (and I never have been). Thankfully, the holidays should give me plenty of time to get better, or at least less comically awful. In the ...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Scum's Wish   2018 Dec  4, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    James checks out this sexually charged teen melodrama with a surprisingly heartfelt edge, while Paul runs down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I saw Mirai last week, and it's an interesting film, particularly if you've seen any of Mamoru Hosoda's other movies. It's one of those stories that manages to be about children without being exclusively for children. If it's playing in your area, you m...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!

It also means that some of this week's price links might be out of date (since I usually put these columns together on Saturday), so ...                    column          5 comments       Shelf Life - Terraformars Revenge   2018 Nov 20, 02:00 5 comments                 anime    Paul checks out the crude but effective sequel to a troubled anime series about fighting giant bugs on Mars, plus a breakdown of all this week's new anime releases! ―  Something about living in the Northeastern US has a tendency to warp one's mind in very particular ways.

Paul Jensen finds out. Plus, all this week's new anime releases! ―  A friend of mine is headed to Anime NYC next weekend.

It's a delightfully twisted little comedy, a fun send-up of both zombie and idol shows. I know that sounds insane, but it works better than it sounds. Welcome to Shelf Life.

I'm just hoping this doesn't make life more...                    column          40 comments       Shelf Life - Angel Cop   2018 Oct 15, 23:00 40 comments                 anime    This cyberpunk '80s OVA may be nostalgic for some fans, but it's hardly angelic.

PLUS: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I rarely end up revisiting any of my old streaming review shows, if only because writing about a series every week forces you to get just about everything out of it on the first viewing.
