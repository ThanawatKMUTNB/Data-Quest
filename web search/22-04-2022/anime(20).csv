Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga.

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell. There's little reveren...                    feature          20 comments       Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   Apr 20, 21:00 20 comments                 anime    Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime? ― CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight...                    review          2 comments       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all. ―  Kenichi Sonoda's iconic characters make up some of the biggest hits of the 80s and 90s, from Bubblegum Crisis to Gunsmith Cats.

We asked Sato about some of the challenges of playing a dead boy, his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show. ―  I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't ...

I would guess they would still use Funimation's prior authoring, design, etc. resources, since I think they had most of that stuff in-house (except the physical printing, probably).   I would also hope they release the final season (and maybe the movie) in its originally intended form (aside from logos). Otherwise, the box set will be forever incomplete.

Funimation as a brand is essentially no more. I think it's more likely that Crunchyroll will re-release the whole series under their own brand at some point.            I would guess they would still use Funimation's prior authoring, design, etc. resources, since I think they had most of that stuff in-house (except the physical printing, probably).   I would also hope they release the final season (and maybe the movie) in its originally intended form (aside from logos). Otherwise, the box set will be forever incomplete.

No shame to anyone who doesn't care, you all deserve to watch something you enjoy however you want. But personally I have zero interest in supporting such a backwards move that will only hurt the industry moving forward (given how much CR licenses and dubs, it's naive to say otherwise). It would be hypocritical to support these dubs, and then turn around and be upset when they're successful enough for CR to see no reason to change things. And even if an individual dub may sound great, artificially cutting your talent pool so drastically only hurts the industry and the season as a whole, end of story.   And fwiw, it's not even about Dani Chambers having another major role in the same season or whatever, that kinda stuff comes in waves all the time even with remote recording and even the JPN side isn't immune to it either (current record I remember is Yuma Uchida with three or four lead roles in one season). Plus there are actors getting cast like Ben Balmaceda or Josh Bangle who are new to getting major roles, which is always a good thing.    It's that most voice recording from ADR, video games (even AAA), original animation, etc... is still allowing a variety of in-studio + remote recording, but CR/Sony does not want to for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with making a better product. And I just can't support that even if I have watched and enjoyed dubs alongside subs for years prior.

Then again they didn't use the Kirito gag for Kamui in Full Dive, I guess I'm not surprised.

Oh for sure, I'm not naive enough to think my choices would matter. The sudden shift has just been really sad to see as someone who's always wanted that side of the industry to grow and improve for the better, and it actually was until now. And I know it's kind of a silly thing to admit considering there are definitely bigger problems in the anime industry, but it's more exhausting than it's worth to care about something and feel like no one else really does (because they either don't care about dubs already or they're happier that they're getting them faster), so it's easier on me to just step away and just watch subs for now from CR if I don't like what they're doing.

I also want voice actors to be better paid, but anime is a business.  Crunchyroll is going to keep making the great majority of its dubs non-union in Dallas.

I believe the return of timely simuldubs is more related to relaxed COVID restrictions.

It's your own choice to not support them but speaking as someone who's not too thrilled with Crunchyroll's decision either, I don't think it's helpful or fair to punish the TX voice cast for a decision Sony made that's out of their hands until they're able to unionize. Meanwhile until they do the TX talent still has jobs to do and their own families to feed.  And if you're going to abandon Crunchyroll dubs because of the corporate politics but continue watching subs, you should also consider those Japanese anime studios that overwork and underpay their animation staff as well.  Just this season we have Dance Dance Danseur being done by MAPPA who is one of the more infamous Japanese studios known for their mistreatment of their staff yet lots of anime fans will probably watch it whether subbed or dubbed.

If somebody decides they don't want to eat at Chick-fil-a, they're not punishing their local franchise's minimum wage workers by not patronizing it. Kitkat even went out of their way to say they're not directing anyone else to do the same.

Kitkat even went out of their way to say they're not directing anyone else to do the same.         I don't think Chickfila is analogous because in the case of Chickfila your money directly goes to the corporation.  In the case of anime dubs, voice actors are paid by the number of lines they do (which there should be better standards than that) and not by your streaming numbers.  Whether you watch it subbed or dubbed, the voice actors and studio staff are already paid and whether you watch it or not doesn't really effect it other than maybe the streaming numbers.

No shame to anyone who doesn't care, you all deserve to watch something you enjoy however you want. But personally I have zero interest in supporting such a backwards move that will only hurt the industry moving forward (given how much CR licenses and dubs, it's naive to say otherwise). It would be hypocritical to support these dubs, and then turn around and be upset when they're successful enough for CR to see no reason to change things. And even if an individual dub may sound great, artificially cutting your talent pool so drastically only hurts the industry and the season as a whole, end of story.   And fwiw, it's not even about Dani Chambers having another major role in the same season or whatever, that kinda stuff comes in waves all the time even with remote recording and even the JPN side isn't immune to it either (current record I remember is Yuma Uchida with three or four lead roles in one season). Plus there are actors getting cast like Ben Balmaceda or Josh Bangle who are new to getting major roles, which is always a good thing.    It's that most voice recording from ADR, video games (even AAA), original animation, etc... is still allowing a variety of in-studio + remote recording, but CR/Sony does not want to for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with making a better product. And I just can't support that even if I have watched and enjoyed dubs alongside subs for years prior.

Then again they didn't use the Kirito gag for Kamui in Full Dive, I guess I'm not surprised.

Oh for sure, I'm not naive enough to think my choices would matter. The sudden shift has just been really sad to see as someone who's always wanted that side of the industry to grow and improve for the better, and it actually was until now. And I know it's kind of a silly thing to admit considering there are definitely bigger problems in the anime industry, but it's more exhausting than it's worth to care about something and feel like no one else really does (because they either don't care about dubs already or they're happier that they're getting them faster), so it's easier on me to just step away and just watch subs for now from CR if I don't like what they're doing.

I also want voice actors to be better paid, but anime is a business.  Crunchyroll is going to keep making the great majority of its dubs non-union in Dallas.

I believe the return of timely simuldubs is more related to relaxed COVID restrictions.

It's your own choice to not support them but speaking as someone who's not too thrilled with Crunchyroll's decision either, I don't think it's helpful or fair to punish the TX voice cast for a decision Sony made that's out of their hands until they're able to unionize. Meanwhile until they do the TX talent still has jobs to do and their own families to feed.  And if you're going to abandon Crunchyroll dubs because of the corporate politics but continue watching subs, you should also consider those Japanese anime studios that overwork and underpay their animation staff as well.  Just this season we have Dance Dance Danseur being done by MAPPA who is one of the more infamous Japanese studios known for their mistreatment of their staff yet lots of anime fans will probably watch it whether subbed or dubbed.

I don't think Chickfila is analogous because in the case of Chickfila your money directly goes to the corporation.  In the case of anime dubs, voice actors are paid by the number of lines they do (which there should be better standards than that) and not by your streaming numbers.  Whether you watch it subbed or dubbed, the voice actors and studio staff are already paid and whether you watch it or not doesn't really effect it other than maybe the streaming numbers.

No shame to anyone who doesn't care, you all deserve to watch something you enjoy however you want. But personally I have zero interest in supporting such a backwards move that will only hurt the industry moving forward (given how much CR licenses and dubs, it's naive to say otherwise). It would be hypocritical to support these dubs, and then turn around and be upset when they're successful enough for CR to see no reason to change things. And even if an individual dub may sound great, artificially cutting your talent pool so drastically only hurts the industry and the season as a whole, end of story.   And fwiw, it's not even about Dani Chambers having another major role in the same season or whatever, that kinda stuff comes in waves all the time even with remote recording and even the JPN side isn't immune to it either (current record I remember is Yuma Uchida with three or four lead roles in one season). Plus there are actors getting cast like Ben Balmaceda or Josh Bangle who are new to getting major roles, which is always a good thing.    It's that most voice recording from ADR, video games (even AAA), original animation, etc... is still allowing a variety of in-studio + remote recording, but CR/Sony does not want to for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with making a better product. And I just can't support that even if I have watched and enjoyed dubs alongside subs for years prior.

Then again they didn't use the Kirito gag for Kamui in Full Dive, I guess I'm not surprised.

Oh for sure, I'm not naive enough to think my choices would matter. The sudden shift has just been really sad to see as someone who's always wanted that side of the industry to grow and improve for the better, and it actually was until now. And I know it's kind of a silly thing to admit considering there are definitely bigger problems in the anime industry, but it's more exhausting than it's worth to care about something and feel like no one else really does (because they either don't care about dubs already or they're happier that they're getting them faster), so it's easier on me to just step away and just watch subs for now from CR if I don't like what they're doing.

I also want voice actors to be better paid, but anime is a business.  Crunchyroll is going to keep making the great majority of its dubs non-union in Dallas.

I believe the return of timely simuldubs is more related to relaxed COVID restrictions.

It's your own choice to not support them but speaking as someone who's not too thrilled with Crunchyroll's decision either, I don't think it's helpful or fair to punish the TX voice cast for a decision Sony made that's out of their hands until they're able to unionize. Meanwhile until they do the TX talent still has jobs to do and their own families to feed.  And if you're going to abandon Crunchyroll dubs because of the corporate politics but continue watching subs, you should also consider those Japanese anime studios that overwork and underpay their animation staff as well.  Just this season we have Dance Dance Danseur being done by MAPPA who is one of the more infamous Japanese studios known for their mistreatment of their staff yet lots of anime fans will probably watch it whether subbed or dubbed.

If somebody decides they don't want to eat at Chick-fil-a, they're not punishing their local franchise's minimum wage workers by not patronizing it.

I don't think Chickfila is analogous because in the case of Chickfila your money directly goes to the corporation.  In the case of anime dubs, voice actors are paid by the number of lines they do (which there should be better standards than that) and not by your streaming numbers.  Whether you watch it subbed or dubbed, the voice actors and studio staff are already paid and whether you watch it or not doesn't really effect it other than maybe the streaming numbers.

The sudden shift has just been really sad to see as someone who's always wanted that side of the industry to grow and improve for the better, and it actually was until now. And I know it's kind of a silly thing to admit considering there are definitely bigger problems in the anime industry, but it's more exhausting than it's worth to care about something and feel like no one else really does (because they either don't care about dubs already or they're happier that they're getting them faster), so it's easier on me to just step away and just watch subs for now from CR if I don't like what they're doing.

I also want voice actors to be better paid, but anime is a business.  Crunchyroll is going to keep making the great majority of its dubs non-union in Dallas.

It's your own choice to not support them but speaking as someone who's not too thrilled with Crunchyroll's decision either, I don't think it's helpful or fair to punish the TX voice cast for a decision Sony made that's out of their hands until they're able to unionize. Meanwhile until they do the TX talent still has jobs to do and their own families to feed.  And if you're going to abandon Crunchyroll dubs because of the corporate politics but continue watching subs, you should also consider those Japanese anime studios that overwork and underpay their animation staff as well.  Just this season we have Dance Dance Danseur being done by MAPPA who is one of the more infamous Japanese studios known for their mistreatment of their staff yet lots of anime fans will probably watch it whether subbed or dubbed.

Kitkat even went out of their way to say they're not directing anyone else to do the same.         I don't think Chickfila is analogous because in the case of Chickfila your money directly goes to the corporation.  In the case of anime dubs, voice actors are paid by the number of lines they do (which there should be better standards than that) and not by your streaming numbers.  Whether you watch it subbed or dubbed, the voice actors and studio staff are already paid and whether you watch it or not doesn't really effect it other than maybe the streaming numbers.

And I know it's kind of a silly thing to admit considering there are definitely bigger problems in the anime industry, but it's more exhausting than it's worth to care about something and feel like no one else really does (because they either don't care about dubs already or they're happier that they're getting them faster), so it's easier on me to just step away and just watch subs for now from CR if I don't like what they're doing.

I don't think Chickfila is analogous because in the case of Chickfila your money directly goes to the corporation.  In the case of anime dubs, voice actors are paid by the number of lines they do (which there should be better standards than that) and not by your streaming numbers.  Whether you watch it subbed or dubbed, the voice actors and studio staff are already paid and whether you watch it or not doesn't really effect it other than maybe the streaming numbers.

And fwiw, it's not even about Dani Chambers having another major role in the same season or whatever, that kinda stuff comes in waves all the time even with remote recording and even the JPN side isn't immune to it either (current record I remember is Yuma Uchida with three or four lead roles in one season). Plus there are actors getting cast like Ben Balmaceda or Josh Bangle who are new to getting major roles, which is always a good thing.    It's that most voice recording from ADR, video games (even AAA), original animation, etc... is still allowing a variety of in-studio + remote recording, but CR/Sony does not want to for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with making a better product. And I just can't support that even if I have watched and enjoyed dubs alongside subs for years prior.

I don't think Chickfila is analogous because in the case of Chickfila your money directly goes to the corporation.  In the case of anime dubs, voice actors are paid by the number of lines they do (which there should be better standards than that) and not by your streaming numbers.  Whether you watch it subbed or dubbed, the voice actors and studio staff are already paid and whether you watch it or not doesn't really effect it other than maybe the streaming numbers.

No shame to anyone who doesn't care, you all deserve to watch something you enjoy however you want. But personally I have zero interest in supporting such a backwards move that will only hurt the industry moving forward (given how much CR licenses and dubs, it's naive to say otherwise). It would be hypocritical to support these dubs, and then turn around and be upset when they're successful enough for CR to see no reason to change things. And even if an individual dub may sound great, artificially cutting your talent pool so drastically only hurts the industry and the season as a whole, end of story.   And fwiw, it's not even about Dani Chambers having another major role in the same season or whatever, that kinda stuff comes in waves all the time even with remote recording and even the JPN side isn't immune to it either (current record I remember is Yuma Uchida with three or four lead roles in one season). Plus there are actors getting cast like Ben Balmaceda or Josh Bangle who are new to getting major roles, which is always a good thing.    It's that most voice recording from ADR, video games (even AAA), original animation, etc... is still allowing a variety of in-studio + remote recording, but CR/Sony does not want to for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with making a better product. And I just can't support that even if I have watched and enjoyed dubs alongside subs for years prior.

Oh for sure, I'm not naive enough to think my choices would matter. The sudden shift has just been really sad to see as someone who's always wanted that side of the industry to grow and improve for the better, and it actually was until now. And I know it's kind of a silly thing to admit considering there are definitely bigger problems in the anime industry, but it's more exhausting than it's worth to care about something and feel like no one else really does (because they either don't care about dubs already or they're happier that they're getting them faster), so it's easier on me to just step away and just watch subs for now from CR if I don't like what they're doing.

No shame to anyone who doesn't care, you all deserve to watch something you enjoy however you want. But personally I have zero interest in supporting such a backwards move that will only hurt the industry moving forward (given how much CR licenses and dubs, it's naive to say otherwise). It would be hypocritical to support these dubs, and then turn around and be upset when they're successful enough for CR to see no reason to change things. And even if an individual dub may sound great, artificially cutting your talent pool so drastically only hurts the industry and the season as a whole, end of story.   And fwiw, it's not even about Dani Chambers having another major role in the same season or whatever, that kinda stuff comes in waves all the time even with remote recording and even the JPN side isn't immune to it either (current record I remember is Yuma Uchida with three or four lead roles in one season). Plus there are actors getting cast like Ben Balmaceda or Josh Bangle who are new to getting major roles, which is always a good thing.    It's that most voice recording from ADR, video games (even AAA), original animation, etc... is still allowing a variety of in-studio + remote recording, but CR/Sony does not want to for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with making a better product. And I just can't support that even if I have watched and enjoyed dubs alongside subs for years prior.

Then again they didn't use the Kirito gag for Kamui in Full Dive, I guess I'm not surprised.

News GKIDS to Release Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water TV Anime With 4K Restoration   posted on 2022-04-20 23:46 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Company to release series directed by Evangelion's Hideaki Anno on home video    GKIDS announced on Wednesday that it has acquired the North American rights for Gainax's science-fiction adventure anime Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water, and it will release the series on home video, based on a new 4K restoration.    GKIDS describes the story:   It's 1889 and people from around the globe are flocking to Paris to see scientific achievements at the Exposition Universelle despite rumors of dangers lurking in the oceans. While attending the fair, teenaged inventor Jean meets Nadia, a mysterious girl who possesses a highly sought-after crystal called Blue Water. Pursued by nefarious forces, the pair journey by sea and by sky to escape their would-be captors and to discover the secret of the crystal.   The staff featured director Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion, His and Her Circumstances), character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honnêamise, Evangelion, Summer Wars), sound director Katsunori Shimizu (Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee, Fushigi Yugi), and musical composer Shiro Sagisu (Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Evangelion).    Sentai Filmworks previously released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The anime was previously released on video tape by Streamline Pictures, and on video tape and DVD by ADV Films.

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.        Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.        Hello, Melancholic! GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.         I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.        Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.        Hello, Melancholic! GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.         I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost. We asked Sato about some of the challenges of playing a dead boy, his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right? The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hund...                    ep. review          122 comments       Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story ‒ SERIES FINALE   Apr 21, 23:30 122 comments                 anime    What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.                           ep. review          12 comments       Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 21, 03:30 12 comments                 anime    This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies.                    ep. review          10 comments       Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 21, 02:30 10 comments                 anime    The calm, understated progression of them working through their worries across these first three episodes is a charming combination of slice-of-life and family drama.                    ep. review          4 comments       Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ‒ SEASON PREMIERE   Apr 21, 00:30 4 comments                 anime    Here it is everyone: the return of our socially-awkward teenagers who, after two seasons, still have little to no idea how to properly process their emotions.                    review                Catch These Hands! GN 1   Apr 21, 00:00                 manga    Two former delinquents cross paths again in adulthood. Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell. There's little reveren...                    ep. review          10 comments       Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 20, 00:30 10 comments                 anime    Truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy.                    review          2 comments       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.        Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.        Hello, Melancholic! GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.         I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost. We asked Sato about some of the challenges of playing a dead boy, his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right? The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really?

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much).

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

22-04-2022,anime,9,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-20/why-girls-und-panzer-works-so-well/.183891,Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres.

Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!

She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.

GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.  « »     Review        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right? The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hund...                    review                Catch These Hands!

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell.

It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling.

GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.  « »     Review        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               review                The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right? The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hund...                    review                Catch These Hands!

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell. There's little reveren...                           review          2 comments       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!
