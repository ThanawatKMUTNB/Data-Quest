Good that others can get this too. Wonder if it was a timed exclusive but the bump up for XC3 changed those plans. Switch is loaded for July.

Might double dip with a Steam sale since Namco Bandai or whatever they're called now are one of the few Japanese Publishers that do good sales on Steam along with NIS. Good that others can get this too. Wonder if it was a timed exclusive but the bump up for XC3 changed those plans. Switch is loaded for July.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

Capitol of the Bee Train ""girls with guns on the run"" series of the 00s, Nafrece is now home to the finest sports anime I have seen in years.    Great review. Truly outstanding.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

Shame that there are at least two worthless m*les who are relevant. Serious letdown, reminds me a lot of Two Car. Hopefully those m*les don't get in the way of the Golf Girls' Story and the girls will stand out more. At least this is what the poster should have been.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

The story of a person taking on golf to help those close to them? Both Eve & Happy would get along swimmingly!            Doesn't fit really. Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.)

It airs every weekday at 5:58 a.m.    10-year-old actress Haruka Aoki (Liza in the Japanese dub of Mighty Express) voices the titular character Chiikawa as her first television anime voice acting role. 11-year-old actor Masato Tanaka (Okko's Inn) voices Hachiware. Ari Ozawa voices Usagi.    The cast also includes:     Yuka Iguchi as Momonga, who always has a cute face   Tomokazu Sugita as Pochette no Yoroi-san, who loves cute things   Hiroki Touchi as Rōdō no Yoroi-san, who does receptionist work   Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Ramen no Yoroi-san, who runs the Rō ramen shop   Yūma Uchida as Rakko, someone that Chiikawa and friends admire   Takayuki Asai as Kuri-Manjū, who takes care of cuisine    Takenori Mihara (Lovely Movie: Itoshi no Muco) is directing the anime.

The manga follows the sometimes happy, sometimes sad, and a tad stressful daily life of ""some sort of small, cute creature"" (Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu) known as Chiikawa. Chiikawa enjoys delicious food with bees and rabbits, toils hard every day for the rewards of work, and still maintains a smile.    Nagano originally started serializing the manga under the title Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu on Twitter in January 2020, and Kodansha published the third compiled book volume on March 23.

News Chiikawa Anime's Promo Video Streamed   posted on 2022-04-21 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime premiered on April 4    The official website for the anime of Nagano's Chiikawa manga unveiled a promotional video on Thursday:      The anime premiered on April 4 within Fuji TV's morning news and entertainment program Mezamashi Terebi. It airs every weekday at 5:58 a.m.    10-year-old actress Haruka Aoki (Liza in the Japanese dub of Mighty Express) voices the titular character Chiikawa as her first television anime voice acting role. 11-year-old actor Masato Tanaka (Okko's Inn) voices Hachiware. Ari Ozawa voices Usagi.    The cast also includes:     Yuka Iguchi as Momonga, who always has a cute face   Tomokazu Sugita as Pochette no Yoroi-san, who loves cute things   Hiroki Touchi as Rōdō no Yoroi-san, who does receptionist work   Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Ramen no Yoroi-san, who runs the Rō ramen shop   Yūma Uchida as Rakko, someone that Chiikawa and friends admire   Takayuki Asai as Kuri-Manjū, who takes care of cuisine    Takenori Mihara (Lovely Movie: Itoshi no Muco) is directing the anime. Shūgo Tokumaru is composing the anime's music. As previously announced, Doga Kobo is producing the anime.    The manga follows the sometimes happy, sometimes sad, and a tad stressful daily life of ""some sort of small, cute creature"" (Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu) known as Chiikawa. Chiikawa enjoys delicious food with bees and rabbits, toils hard every day for the rewards of work, and still maintains a smile.    Nagano originally started serializing the manga under the title Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu on Twitter in January 2020, and Kodansha published the third compiled book volume on March 23.

News Rintaro Koike, Masayuki Taguchi's Black Joke Manga Nears Climax   posted on 2022-04-19 14:15 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga about island off Tokyo where gambling, prostitution is legal launched in 2008    This year's fifth issue of Akita Shoten's Young Champion Retsu magazine revealed on Tuesday that Rintaro Koike and Masayuki Taguchi's Black Joke manga is approaching its climax in the magazine's next issue on May 17.    The manga is set on the fictional Neon Island in Tokyo Bay, a place where gambling and prostitution has been legalized. There, gangs vie for control of the underground economy. The story centers on TD Hot Spring Hotel, the island's sole Japanese-style entertainment facility.    Koike and Taguchi launched the manga in Akita Shoten's Young Champion magazine in 2008, and the series moved to Young Champion Retsu in 2011. Akita Shoten published the manga's 10th compiled book volume in July 2020.    Koike was the original writer for the Hurrah! Sailor PlayStation 2 game, which inspired Katsuwo Nakane's manga adaptation of the same name. Infinity Studios and ComicsOne previously published the manga in English.    Taguchi is perhaps best known for the manga adaptation of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale novel. The manga ran in Young Champion from 2000 to 2006, and Tokyopop published the whole manga in English. Tokyopop also published Taguchi's Lives manga. Media Blasters published Taguchi's Baron Gong Battle manga.

News Rintaro Koike, Masayuki Taguchi's Black Joke Manga Nears Climax   posted on 2022-04-19 14:15 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga about island off Tokyo where gambling, prostitution is legal launched in 2008    This year's fifth issue of Akita Shoten's Young Champion Retsu magazine revealed on Tuesday that Rintaro Koike and Masayuki Taguchi's Black Joke manga is approaching its climax in the magazine's next issue on May 17.    The manga is set on the fictional Neon Island in Tokyo Bay, a place where gambling and prostitution has been legalized. There, gangs vie for control of the underground economy. The story centers on TD Hot Spring Hotel, the island's sole Japanese-style entertainment facility.    Koike and Taguchi launched the manga in Akita Shoten's Young Champion magazine in 2008, and the series moved to Young Champion Retsu in 2011. Akita Shoten published the manga's 10th compiled book volume in July 2020.    Koike was the original writer for the Hurrah! Sailor PlayStation 2 game, which inspired Katsuwo Nakane's manga adaptation of the same name. Infinity Studios and ComicsOne previously published the manga in English.    Taguchi is perhaps best known for the manga adaptation of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale novel. The manga ran in Young Champion from 2000 to 2006, and Tokyopop published the whole manga in English. Tokyopop also published Taguchi's Lives manga. Media Blasters published Taguchi's Baron Gong Battle manga.

News Rintaro Koike, Masayuki Taguchi's Black Joke Manga Nears Climax   posted on 2022-04-19 14:15 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga about island off Tokyo where gambling, prostitution is legal launched in 2008    This year's fifth issue of Akita Shoten's Young Champion Retsu magazine revealed on Tuesday that Rintaro Koike and Masayuki Taguchi's Black Joke manga is approaching its climax in the magazine's next issue on May 17.    The manga is set on the fictional Neon Island in Tokyo Bay, a place where gambling and prostitution has been legalized. There, gangs vie for control of the underground economy. The story centers on TD Hot Spring Hotel, the island's sole Japanese-style entertainment facility.    Koike and Taguchi launched the manga in Akita Shoten's Young Champion magazine in 2008, and the series moved to Young Champion Retsu in 2011. Akita Shoten published the manga's 10th compiled book volume in July 2020.    Koike was the original writer for the Hurrah! Sailor PlayStation 2 game, which inspired Katsuwo Nakane's manga adaptation of the same name. Infinity Studios and ComicsOne previously published the manga in English.    Taguchi is perhaps best known for the manga adaptation of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale novel. The manga ran in Young Champion from 2000 to 2006, and Tokyopop published the whole manga in English. Tokyopop also published Taguchi's Lives manga. Media Blasters published Taguchi's Baron Gong Battle manga.
