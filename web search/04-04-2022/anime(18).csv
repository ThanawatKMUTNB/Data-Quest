Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.

I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 677       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

No, really....isn't it funny how a series that isn't even smut ends up with scenes that are 100 times sexier than the most pandering smut out there!?   Shirtless, feverish, vulnerable Vanitas....and we also got to see him blush from embarrassment for the first time ever.    God Bless This Blessed Day. I am so happy.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

EVERYONE in this show is so freaking attractive....coupled with Bone's exquisite production values...basically makes every episode a treat to watch, honestly.   Still don't like the new ED song meh.

Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.

I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange.

I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 677       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

What became of Vanitas' earring and cuffs?  Did Jeanne take them (why?), or did he remove them himself (why?)?  Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

No, really....isn't it funny how a series that isn't even smut ends up with scenes that are 100 times sexier than the most pandering smut out there!?   Shirtless, feverish, vulnerable Vanitas....and we also got to see him blush from embarrassment for the first time ever.    God Bless This Blessed Day. I am so happy.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

Yeah....15....pretty mad Best Character got like 30 seconds of screentime...but Chloe's flashback with little Jeanne was cute.   EVERYONE in this show is so freaking attractive....coupled with Bone's exquisite production values...basically makes every episode a treat to watch, honestly.   Still don't like the new ED song meh.

Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.

I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 677       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.

I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 677       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

No, really....isn't it funny how a series that isn't even smut ends up with scenes that are 100 times sexier than the most pandering smut out there!?   Shirtless, feverish, vulnerable Vanitas....and we also got to see him blush from embarrassment for the first time ever.    God Bless This Blessed Day. I am so happy.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.3           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.3           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.3           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

News Shaman King & a Garden Manga Spinoff Ends in May   posted on 2022-04-03 16:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Kyo Nuesawa, Jet Kusamura launched spinoff about female characters in December 2020    The May issue of Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine revealed on Friday that Kyo Nuesawa and Jet Kusamura's Shaman King & a Garden manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 2.    Kodansha USA Publishing is releasing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:   The women of Shaman King are no pushovers, and the trio of Canna, Matilda, and Marion are no exception! Find about the origins of this team in Shaman King & a Garden!   Kodansha USA Publishing released the manga's second volume on January 11.    The manga launched in Nakayoshi in December 2020 as a spinoff of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga. Nuesawa is drawing the manga, and Kusamura (Shaman King: Red Crimson manga creator) is credited for the concept. Kodansha published the manga's third volume in Japan on March 17.    Shaman King debuted in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1998. The series abruptly ended in 2004, although a reprinting of the manga revealed a ""true ending"" in 2009. Viz Media previously 32 volumes of the original Shaman King manga from 2003 to 2011, but it no longer holds the license to the manga. Shueisha originally held the rights to the manga in Japan.    The manga has inspired a new anime series that premiered in April 2021. The anime will adapt all 35 volumes of the manga's new complete edition. Kodansha USA Publishing is publishing the original Shaman King manga and is also releasing the Shaman King: Zero, Shaman King Flowers, Shaman King: Red Crimson, and Shaman King: Super Star spinoff manga in English.

News Shaman King & a Garden Manga Spinoff Ends in May   posted on 2022-04-03 16:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Kyo Nuesawa, Jet Kusamura launched spinoff about female characters in December 2020    The May issue of Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine revealed on Friday that Kyo Nuesawa and Jet Kusamura's Shaman King & a Garden manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 2.    Kodansha USA Publishing is releasing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:   The women of Shaman King are no pushovers, and the trio of Canna, Matilda, and Marion are no exception! Find about the origins of this team in Shaman King & a Garden!   Kodansha USA Publishing released the manga's second volume on January 11.    The manga launched in Nakayoshi in December 2020 as a spinoff of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga. Nuesawa is drawing the manga, and Kusamura (Shaman King: Red Crimson manga creator) is credited for the concept. Kodansha published the manga's third volume in Japan on March 17.    Shaman King debuted in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1998. The series abruptly ended in 2004, although a reprinting of the manga revealed a ""true ending"" in 2009. Viz Media previously 32 volumes of the original Shaman King manga from 2003 to 2011, but it no longer holds the license to the manga. Shueisha originally held the rights to the manga in Japan.    The manga has inspired a new anime series that premiered in April 2021. The anime will adapt all 35 volumes of the manga's new complete edition. Kodansha USA Publishing is publishing the original Shaman King manga and is also releasing the Shaman King: Zero, Shaman King Flowers, Shaman King: Red Crimson, and Shaman King: Super Star spinoff manga in English.

News Shaman King & a Garden Manga Spinoff Ends in May   posted on 2022-04-03 16:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Kyo Nuesawa, Jet Kusamura launched spinoff about female characters in December 2020    The May issue of Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine revealed on Friday that Kyo Nuesawa and Jet Kusamura's Shaman King & a Garden manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 2.    Kodansha USA Publishing is releasing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:   The women of Shaman King are no pushovers, and the trio of Canna, Matilda, and Marion are no exception! Find about the origins of this team in Shaman King & a Garden!   Kodansha USA Publishing released the manga's second volume on January 11.    The manga launched in Nakayoshi in December 2020 as a spinoff of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga. Nuesawa is drawing the manga, and Kusamura (Shaman King: Red Crimson manga creator) is credited for the concept. Kodansha published the manga's third volume in Japan on March 17.    Shaman King debuted in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1998. The series abruptly ended in 2004, although a reprinting of the manga revealed a ""true ending"" in 2009. Viz Media previously 32 volumes of the original Shaman King manga from 2003 to 2011, but it no longer holds the license to the manga. Shueisha originally held the rights to the manga in Japan.    The manga has inspired a new anime series that premiered in April 2021. The anime will adapt all 35 volumes of the manga's new complete edition. Kodansha USA Publishing is publishing the original Shaman King manga and is also releasing the Shaman King: Zero, Shaman King Flowers, Shaman King: Red Crimson, and Shaman King: Super Star spinoff manga in English.

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 10 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.3                  How would you rate episode 11 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.  ",positive,en,{}

I had pretty much given up hope already...  Now, this is a good opportunity to replay the first game as well. For some reason, I think this game is underrated in the west despite it often being viewed as a cult classic.  I just really like the writing of this game and even a personality-less MC couldn't change my mind. Heck, I liked how the player finds out her original personality and how she slowly regains it.   Tho this gimmick made a certain route very hard to sit through. It's easier to make fun of a situation when there is MC acting as a wall between what is happening and yourself. My endless frustration with it didn't change the fact that I still made fun of it after finishing the game. It just got harder while playing it.

I had pretty much given up hope already...  Now, this is a good opportunity to replay the first game as well. For some reason, I think this game is underrated in the west despite it often being viewed as a cult classic.  I just really like the writing of this game and even a personality-less MC couldn't change my mind. Heck, I liked how the player finds out her original personality and how she slowly regains it.   Tho this gimmick made a certain route very hard to sit through. It's easier to make fun of a situation when there is MC acting as a wall between what is happening and yourself. My endless frustration with it didn't change the fact that I still made fun of it after finishing the game. It just got harder while playing it.

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists.

These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}
04-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-01/gundam-build-fighters-and-the-power-of-toy-anime/.184235,Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"        Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them.

A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}
04-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-01/gundam-build-fighters-and-the-power-of-toy-anime/.184235,Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second.

I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.    Rating:                  86 Season 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.    Rating:                  86 Season 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.    Rating:                  86 Season 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.4           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.4           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.4           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.4           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.
