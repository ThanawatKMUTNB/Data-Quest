Phantom Breaker: Omnia Spicy Edition Confirmed…to be Extra Hot   Apr  2nd 2022         The fast-paced 2D anime fighting game by Rocket Panda Games and MAGES reaches 300,000 SHU on the Scoville Scale  El Habanero, Calif. - April 1, 2022 - Publisher Rocket Panda Games and developer MAGES have unveiled the latest update to Phantom Breaker: Omnia, and it's dangerously saucy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrOnmrpc5lk  In collaboration with THE ANNOUNCER, Rocket Panda Games is pleased to present the Spicy Edition! This update will come with two scorching new levels of commentary and will be available on all platforms this summer for the listed price of AB-SO-LUTE-LY NOTHING. No, we didn't forget to cut and paste that info in. It's so free that THE ANNOUNCER screamed “Medic!!!” just on principle. “You said you wanted more, and we listened!” said Gail Salamanca, Co-founder of Rocket Panda Games. “It's been 109 days since the trailer released, and we're so happy that Phantom Breaker: Omnia fans will be able to experience even more 'Yah! Yah! Yah! Boom Bah Yah!'”  Story A mysterious man named Phantom works from the shadows to lure powerful fighters into perpetual battle against one another. He bestows upon them mystical weapons known as “Fu-mension Artifacts” and promises the ultimate prize to the winner: a wish. Unbeknownst to these chosen hopefuls, however, their clashes shake the fabric of space-time itself, weakening the barriers between parallel universes and bringing Phantom one step closer to his own dearest desire—the return of his destructive powers and the end of the world.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 542       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm glad to have Arifureta back looking better than ever.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 542       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 542       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 542       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

REVIEW: Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 [1/4] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," I love Yue just casually sitting on Hajime's crotch and undressing so she and Hajime could have sub sex. That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.  ",positive,en,{}

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.  ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.

Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor.

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.   ",positive,en,{}
04-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/thermae-romae-novae/.183660,Thermae Romae Novae - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.
