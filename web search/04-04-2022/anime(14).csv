This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!        discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!        discuss this in the forum (6 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?

And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.

He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.

This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder.

Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did.

Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice.

But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!     ",positive,en,{}

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform. When they're not writing and reviewing, you can find them on their  Twitter or on their  Instagram where she's always up to something.   <prevEpisode 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episodes 6-7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (19 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Tribe Nine Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform.

I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.

Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee. What a release strategist you are.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee. What a release strategist you are.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee. What a release strategist you are.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????).

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee. What a release strategist you are.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season.

They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????).

They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.  ",negative,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology.

Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister.

The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (73 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit.

Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.   ",positive,en,{}
04-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/the-executioner-and-her-way-of-life/.183507,The Executioner and Her Way of Life - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode.

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022.

Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.

I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do.

Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.

The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring.

That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (72 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all.

It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.
