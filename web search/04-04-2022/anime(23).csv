News Live-Action 'The Violence Action' Film's Teaser Showcases More Cast, August 19 Opening   posted on 2022-04-01 09:11 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Yosuke Sugino, Ōji Suzuka, Fumika Baba, Win Morisaki, Yūri Ōta, Shunsuke Daito join cast    The official website for the live-action film adaptation of author Shin Sawada and artist Renji Asai's The Violence Action manga posted a teaser trailer and teaser visual on Friday. Both showcase more cast members and the August 19 opening for the film.           Kanna Hashimoto (left in image below) plays protagonist Kei Kikuno.     The main cast includes (from left to right, top to bottom in image below):    Fumika Baba as Shopkeeper Yosuke Sugino as Terano  Kanna Hashimoto as Kei Kikuno  Ōji Suzuka as Watanabe  Win Morisaki as Kaneko   Takashi Okamura as Zura-san  Yu Shirota as Michitaka-kun  TYūri Ōta as Daria  TShunsuke Daito as Ayabe   Jiro Sato as Sandaime (third generation leader)  Katsunori Takahashi as Kinoshita          The manga's story centers on Kei Kikuno, an assassin who seems to be an easygoing and cute girl next door but is actually a top hitgirl. Kei skillfully handles jobs with her gun expertise and physical prowess.    Tōichirō Rutō is directing the film, and is co-writing the script alongside Itaru Era.    The series launched on Shogakukan's online magazine Yawaraka Spirits in April 2016. The manga went on hiatus from March 2018 to June 2019 due to a creator's poor health. The series ranked on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Asai drew a manga adaptation of Mamoru Hosoda's The Boy and The Beast anime film, and Yen Press released the series in English in North America.    Daisuke Muroi is Sawada's real name, and he drew the Reiri manga with author Hitoshi Iwaaki (Historie, Parasyte) from December 2015 to December 2018.

News Live-Action 'The Violence Action' Film's Teaser Showcases More Cast, August 19 Opening   posted on 2022-04-01 09:11 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Yosuke Sugino, Ōji Suzuka, Fumika Baba, Win Morisaki, Yūri Ōta, Shunsuke Daito join cast    The official website for the live-action film adaptation of author Shin Sawada and artist Renji Asai's The Violence Action manga posted a teaser trailer and teaser visual on Friday. Both showcase more cast members and the August 19 opening for the film.           Kanna Hashimoto (left in image below) plays protagonist Kei Kikuno.     The main cast includes (from left to right, top to bottom in image below):    Fumika Baba as Shopkeeper Yosuke Sugino as Terano  Kanna Hashimoto as Kei Kikuno  Ōji Suzuka as Watanabe  Win Morisaki as Kaneko   Takashi Okamura as Zura-san  Yu Shirota as Michitaka-kun  TYūri Ōta as Daria  TShunsuke Daito as Ayabe   Jiro Sato as Sandaime (third generation leader)  Katsunori Takahashi as Kinoshita          The manga's story centers on Kei Kikuno, an assassin who seems to be an easygoing and cute girl next door but is actually a top hitgirl. Kei skillfully handles jobs with her gun expertise and physical prowess.    Tōichirō Rutō is directing the film, and is co-writing the script alongside Itaru Era.    The series launched on Shogakukan's online magazine Yawaraka Spirits in April 2016. The manga went on hiatus from March 2018 to June 2019 due to a creator's poor health. The series ranked on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Asai drew a manga adaptation of Mamoru Hosoda's The Boy and The Beast anime film, and Yen Press released the series in English in North America.    Daisuke Muroi is Sawada's real name, and he drew the Reiri manga with author Hitoshi Iwaaki (Historie, Parasyte) from December 2015 to December 2018.

The newly announced cast members voice the star players in the protagonist Ryō Mizushima's badminton team. These two characters debut in the anime's second episode on April 9:    Kishō Taniyama as Kento Yusa, the strongest superstar player of his generation, but he has an egotistical side   Hiroki Takahashi as Yūsuke Yokokawa, Yusa's doubles partner, whom the younger players consider a big-brother figure they can count on for advice     The anime premiered on April 2. The anime airs on YTV, NTV, and their affiliates on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.    The main cast includes:    Natsuki Hanae as Ryō Mizushima   Yōhei Azakami as Shōhei Sakaki   Makoto Furukawa as Kо̄ki Matsuda   Kensho Ono as Taichi Higashiyama   Tetsuya Kakihara as Yо̄ji Higashiyama   Yuuki Kaji as Akira Uchida   Minako Kotobuki as Rika Mizushima   Kazuya Nakai as Hitoshi Ebihara   Masaya Matsukaze as Shizuo Nakano   Shimba Tsuchiya as Hirohito Monda    Additionally, real-life badminton players Yūta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino will appear in the anime playing themselves.    The story follows Ryō Mizushima, who joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength.

The newly announced cast members voice the star players in the protagonist Ryō Mizushima's badminton team. These two characters debut in the anime's second episode on April 9:    Kishō Taniyama as Kento Yusa, the strongest superstar player of his generation, but he has an egotistical side   Hiroki Takahashi as Yūsuke Yokokawa, Yusa's doubles partner, whom the younger players consider a big-brother figure they can count on for advice     The anime premiered on April 2. The anime airs on YTV, NTV, and their affiliates on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.    The main cast includes:    Natsuki Hanae as Ryō Mizushima   Yōhei Azakami as Shōhei Sakaki   Makoto Furukawa as Kо̄ki Matsuda   Kensho Ono as Taichi Higashiyama   Tetsuya Kakihara as Yо̄ji Higashiyama   Yuuki Kaji as Akira Uchida   Minako Kotobuki as Rika Mizushima   Kazuya Nakai as Hitoshi Ebihara   Masaya Matsukaze as Shizuo Nakano   Shimba Tsuchiya as Hirohito Monda    Additionally, real-life badminton players Yūta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino will appear in the anime playing themselves.

Sporting goods maker YONEX is supervising and collaborating on the designs for the anime. YONEX assisted on a previous badminton anime, Hanebad! from 2018.

It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3769       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 5:38 pm            This seems like it's taking some influence from Usagi but turning it into your typical kid Superhero cartoon, with a young, rookie, teen protagonist joining up with a group of colorful, eclectic, and capable friends to fight monsters like a Saturday Morning Cartoon.   Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

Otherwise I'm going to have to buy a multi-region blu-ray player and import the US disc. Your review has only added to my desperation!

To put the amount of extras this Perfect Disc has, I would say be akin to all the extra features the Lord the Rings films have since it's release. This was my Blu-Ray of the Year of any genre last year (late December). What kind of madness it will be if Discotek throws ""everything and the kitchen sink"" as they say on this disc for Gunbuster.    One last thing.Hope your select/enter button on your Blu-Ray/Harmony remote is big and functional because there is a lot pressing to do.

Uncivil wars? That could change in the future, but they could still just do a set with 1-4. However, a steelbook is more likely I'll admit.

It's the same reason I got their release of Memories (which I STILL haven't watched somehow).

Posted: Sat Apr 02, 2022 5:05 pm            Minor correction:     Quote:    The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself.            That second ""B-ko"" should be ""C-ko"".   I've been wanting to buy this Blu-Ray just for the new film transfer but I'll probably have to import it from the USA since Amazon Canada has it at $80 Canadian (which is around twice what I'd pay from some of the American anime online shops including shipping to Canada even taking into account the exchange rate). I'll still keep the 2002 DVD edition even with the super-saturated remaster since it came with the soundtrack CD (plus the Blu-Ray won't play on either of my laptops).

To put the amount of extras this Perfect Disc has, I would say be akin to all the extra features the Lord the Rings films have since it's release. This was my Blu-Ray of the Year of any genre last year (late December). What kind of madness it will be if Discotek throws ""everything and the kitchen sink"" as they say on this disc for Gunbuster.    One last thing.Hope your select/enter button on your Blu-Ray/Harmony remote is big and functional because there is a lot pressing to do.

Posted: Sat Apr 02, 2022 5:05 pm            Minor correction:     Quote:    The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself.            That second ""B-ko"" should be ""C-ko"".   I've been wanting to buy this Blu-Ray just for the new film transfer but I'll probably have to import it from the USA since Amazon Canada has it at $80 Canadian (which is around twice what I'd pay from some of the American anime online shops including shipping to Canada even taking into account the exchange rate). I'll still keep the 2002 DVD edition even with the super-saturated remaster since it came with the soundtrack CD (plus the Blu-Ray won't play on either of my laptops).

To put the amount of extras this Perfect Disc has, I would say be akin to all the extra features the Lord the Rings films have since it's release. This was my Blu-Ray of the Year of any genre last year (late December). What kind of madness it will be if Discotek throws ""everything and the kitchen sink"" as they say on this disc for Gunbuster.    One last thing.Hope your select/enter button on your Blu-Ray/Harmony remote is big and functional because there is a lot pressing to do.

To put the amount of extras this Perfect Disc has, I would say be akin to all the extra features the Lord the Rings films have since it's release. This was my Blu-Ray of the Year of any genre last year (late December). What kind of madness it will be if Discotek throws ""everything and the kitchen sink"" as they say on this disc for Gunbuster.    One last thing.Hope your select/enter button on your Blu-Ray/Harmony remote is big and functional because there is a lot pressing to do.

Otherwise I'm going to have to buy a multi-region blu-ray player and import the US disc. Your review has only added to my desperation!

To put the amount of extras this Perfect Disc has, I would say be akin to all the extra features the Lord the Rings films have since it's release. This was my Blu-Ray of the Year of any genre last year (late December). What kind of madness it will be if Discotek throws ""everything and the kitchen sink"" as they say on this disc for Gunbuster.    One last thing.Hope your select/enter button on your Blu-Ray/Harmony remote is big and functional because there is a lot pressing to do.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022, Mar 19-25   by Daniel DeLorme, Mar 30th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022, Mar 19-25   by Daniel DeLorme, Mar 30th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022, Mar 19-25   by Daniel DeLorme, Mar 30th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally.

If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.  ",positive,en,{}
