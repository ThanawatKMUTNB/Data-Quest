I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

News Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai Live-Action Film's New Clip Features Kei Tanaka, Sara Minami   posted on 2022-04-01 20:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film based on Usamaru Furuya's manga opened in Japan on Friday    Nikkatsu began streaming a fourth clip from the live-action film of Usamaru Furuya's Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai (I Want to be Killed by a High School Girl) suspense manga on Thursday. The clip shows the protagonist Haruto Higashiyama (played by Kei Tanaka) and one of his students Maho (played by Sara Minami) cleaning up a student club room together after an earthquake, when Maho fixes Haruto's crooked tie for him.      Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai follows a man who becomes a high school teacher in his nine-year plan to be killed by a beautiful girl — even though he doesn't particularly want to die.    Kei Tanaka (.hack//The Movie, live-action Library Wars, Tokyo University Story) stars in the film as protagonist Haruto Higashiyama. Other cast members include Sara Minami as Maho, Yūmi Kawai as Aoi, Riko as Kyōko, Mizuki Kayashima as Aika, Kanata Hosoda, Natsu Katō, Nonoka Kubo, and Kin Takao. Yuko Oshima plays Satsuki Fukagawa, a psychologist and the former lover of protagonist Haruto Higashiyama.    Hideo Jōjō (Dangerous Drugs of Sex/Sei no Gekiyaku, On the Edge of Their Seats/Alps Stand no Hashi no Hō) is directing and writing the film. Alisa is performing the film's image song ""tell me i'm broken.""    Yutaka Tanito is developing and producing the film. The company Dub is producing the film, and Nikkatsu is developing and distributing.    The film opened in Japan on Friday.    Furuya (Lychee Light Club, No Longer Human, Amane Gymnasium, 51 Ways to Save Her, Genkaku Picasso) began the manga in Shinchosha's quarterly magazine Go Go Bunch  in 2013, and Shinchosha shipped the first compiled volume in February 2015. He ended the manga in July 2016, and the second and final volume shipped thereafter.

News Pacific Rim: The Black Anime's Final Season's Trailer Streamed   posted on 2022-04-01 02:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd season premieres on April 19    Netflix began streaming a trailer for the second and final season of its Pacific Rim: The Black anime series on Thursday.      Although the trailer lists an April 14 date, Netflix announced that the second season will premiere on April 19.    Netflix describes the second season:   In the epic series conclusion of Pacific Rim: The Black (S2), the journey is far from over. Our brave siblings Taylor and Hayley still hope to reach the safety of Sydney aboard Atlas Destroyer, the scaled-down training Jaeger left behind when Australia was evacuated. With teenage assassin Mei and the mysterious human/kaiju hybrid bOy joining Taylor and Hayley, this makeshift family must cross a dangerous territory controlled by the bloodthirsty cult Sisters of the Kaiju. These zealots, led by the enigmatic High Priestess, are convinced that bOy is their long-awaited Messiah and will stop at nothing to indoctrinate him into their dark circle – something Hayley would sacrifice everything to prevent.   The first season had seven half-hour episodes and debuted worldwide in March 2021.    Polygon Pictures (BLAME!, Godzilla: Kaijū Wakusei film trilogy) is producing the 3D-animated series based on the live-action Pacific Rim films. Craig Kyle and Greg Johnson are the co-showrunners on the series by Legendary Entertainment.

News Pacific Rim: The Black Anime's Final Season's Trailer Streamed   posted on 2022-04-01 02:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd season premieres on April 19    Netflix began streaming a trailer for the second and final season of its Pacific Rim: The Black anime series on Thursday.      Although the trailer lists an April 14 date, Netflix announced that the second season will premiere on April 19.    Netflix describes the second season:   In the epic series conclusion of Pacific Rim: The Black (S2), the journey is far from over. Our brave siblings Taylor and Hayley still hope to reach the safety of Sydney aboard Atlas Destroyer, the scaled-down training Jaeger left behind when Australia was evacuated. With teenage assassin Mei and the mysterious human/kaiju hybrid bOy joining Taylor and Hayley, this makeshift family must cross a dangerous territory controlled by the bloodthirsty cult Sisters of the Kaiju. These zealots, led by the enigmatic High Priestess, are convinced that bOy is their long-awaited Messiah and will stop at nothing to indoctrinate him into their dark circle – something Hayley would sacrifice everything to prevent.   The first season had seven half-hour episodes and debuted worldwide in March 2021.    Polygon Pictures (BLAME!, Godzilla: Kaijū Wakusei film trilogy) is producing the 3D-animated series based on the live-action Pacific Rim films. Craig Kyle and Greg Johnson are the co-showrunners on the series by Legendary Entertainment.

Although the trailer lists an April 14 date, Netflix announced that the second season will premiere on April 19.    Netflix describes the second season:   In the epic series conclusion of Pacific Rim: The Black (S2), the journey is far from over. Our brave siblings Taylor and Hayley still hope to reach the safety of Sydney aboard Atlas Destroyer, the scaled-down training Jaeger left behind when Australia was evacuated. With teenage assassin Mei and the mysterious human/kaiju hybrid bOy joining Taylor and Hayley, this makeshift family must cross a dangerous territory controlled by the bloodthirsty cult Sisters of the Kaiju. These zealots, led by the enigmatic High Priestess, are convinced that bOy is their long-awaited Messiah and will stop at nothing to indoctrinate him into their dark circle – something Hayley would sacrifice everything to prevent.   The first season had seven half-hour episodes and debuted worldwide in March 2021.    Polygon Pictures (BLAME!, Godzilla: Kaijū Wakusei film trilogy) is producing the 3D-animated series based on the live-action Pacific Rim films.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen.

ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.

Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though!

I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.

ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for.

I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below. Take it easy and enjoy the weekend, and try not to be too disappointed when that awesome announcement you saw online turns out to be complete BS, OK?     discuss this in the forum (9 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    This Week in Games homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}
04-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2022-04-01/this-week-in-games-rip-e3/.184241,RIP E3 - This Week in Games - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Hey everyone, it's April Fools’ Day! Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way.

If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements.

04-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2022-04-01/this-week-in-games-rip-e3/.184241,RIP E3 - This Week in Games - Anime News Network:SEA,"   Hey everyone, it's April Fools’ Day! Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

Have to admit, seeing all the seasons and Ash/Satoshi's Pokemon together really hit me in the feels.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some riské jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

You're hella exaggerating just how ""mature"" the Japanese version of Pokemon is. Pokemon is still primarily a children's show, and a franchise aimed at kids. The version we watched growing up is not far displaced from what Pokemon is even in its origin country.

Sometimes it's difficult to believe how long it has been since it first aired, as long as Gamefreak continues making new games I don't think the anime is going to end. I have to congratulate Rica Matsumoto and Ikue Ohtani for  for all the years they have worked on the series as Satoshi and Pikachu.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

Have to admit, seeing all the seasons and Ash/Satoshi's Pokemon together really hit me in the feels.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some riské jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

You're hella exaggerating just how ""mature"" the Japanese version of Pokemon is. Pokemon is still primarily a children's show, and a franchise aimed at kids. The version we watched growing up is not far displaced from what Pokemon is even in its origin country.

Sometimes it's difficult to believe how long it has been since it first aired, as long as Gamefreak continues making new games I don't think the anime is going to end. I have to congratulate Rica Matsumoto and Ikue Ohtani for  for all the years they have worked on the series as Satoshi and Pikachu.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some riské jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

You're hella exaggerating just how ""mature"" the Japanese version of Pokemon is. Pokemon is still primarily a children's show, and a franchise aimed at kids. The version we watched growing up is not far displaced from what Pokemon is even in its origin country.

Sometimes it's difficult to believe how long it has been since it first aired, as long as Gamefreak continues making new games I don't think the anime is going to end. I have to congratulate Rica Matsumoto and Ikue Ohtani for  for all the years they have worked on the series as Satoshi and Pikachu.

While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some riské jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

You're hella exaggerating just how ""mature"" the Japanese version of Pokemon is. Pokemon is still primarily a children's show, and a franchise aimed at kids. The version we watched growing up is not far displaced from what Pokemon is even in its origin country.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic.

Sometimes it's difficult to believe how long it has been since it first aired, as long as Gamefreak continues making new games I don't think the anime is going to end. I have to congratulate Rica Matsumoto and Ikue Ohtani for  for all the years they have worked on the series as Satoshi and Pikachu.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

04-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/cms/discuss/184283,NEWS: Pokémon Anime's 25th Anniversary Promo Video Recaps Ash's Journey - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," The anime feels like it's at it's most unpredictable right now. When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.  ",positive,en,{}
