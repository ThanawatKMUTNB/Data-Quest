Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.

News Amnesia: Memories, Amnesia: Later×Crowd Games' Switch Versions Head West   posted on 2022-04-01 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Idea Factory International's release of Birushana also slated for June 28    Idea Factory International announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

News Amnesia: Memories, Amnesia: Later×Crowd Games' Switch Versions Head West   posted on 2022-04-01 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Idea Factory International's release of Birushana also slated for June 28    Idea Factory International announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

News Amnesia: Memories, Amnesia: Later×Crowd Games' Switch Versions Head West   posted on 2022-04-01 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Idea Factory International's release of Birushana also slated for June 28    Idea Factory International announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

With this, the April Fool's joke is even funnier haha.   I honestly don't remember much about it. I remember liking Yoshino (and being voiced by Inori Minase) and a commando girl. Ah, there was also a rather feminine guy... and a fat guy in the last arc.   Anyway, it's interesting how series we thought were forgotten are making a comeback.

News The Hollywood Reporter: Hollywood Studios Shop for Live-Action Voltron Project   posted on 2022-04-03 18:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Rawson Marshall Thurber would direct, co-write script with Ellen Shanman     The Hollywood Reporter reported on March 23 that Warner Bros., Universal, Amazon, and a few other studios are shopping for the rights to a live-action Voltron project. Rawson Marshall Thurber (Red Notice) would co-write the script with Ellen Shanman and Thurber would also direct.    Todd Lieberman, David Hoberman (Beauty and the Beast 2017), and World Events Productions' Bob Koplar (Voltron: Legendary Defender) would produce the project.    World Events Productions, Ltd. (WEP) and the late Peter O'Keefe adapted the first 1984-1985 Voltron television series from two Toei Animation robot anime: King of Beasts Golion and Armored Fleet Dairugger XV. Both Golion and the first Voltron story centered on young pilots who fight against an empire of alien conquerors — with the help of five mechanized lions that combine to form a robot.    Since the first series, the franchise spawned three television series produced outside Japan: the 3D CG Voltron: The Third Dimension in 1998, the 2D Voltron Force in 2011, and Dreamworks and Netflix's Voltron: Legendary Defender.    The eighth and final season of the Voltron: Legendary Defender animated series premiered on Netflix in December 2018. Netflix is streaming 12 episodes of the original Voltron series under the title Voltron 84.    The Hollywood Reporter stated that Netflix is not among the companies bidding for the upcoming live-action project.      Studios previously attempted a live-action Hollywood project for the franchise in 2007 and then in 2012, but neither project moved forward.

News The Hollywood Reporter: Hollywood Studios Shop for Live-Action Voltron Project   posted on 2022-04-03 18:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Rawson Marshall Thurber would direct, co-write script with Ellen Shanman     The Hollywood Reporter reported on March 23 that Warner Bros., Universal, Amazon, and a few other studios are shopping for the rights to a live-action Voltron project. Rawson Marshall Thurber (Red Notice) would co-write the script with Ellen Shanman and Thurber would also direct.    Todd Lieberman, David Hoberman (Beauty and the Beast 2017), and World Events Productions' Bob Koplar (Voltron: Legendary Defender) would produce the project.    World Events Productions, Ltd. (WEP) and the late Peter O'Keefe adapted the first 1984-1985 Voltron television series from two Toei Animation robot anime: King of Beasts Golion and Armored Fleet Dairugger XV. Both Golion and the first Voltron story centered on young pilots who fight against an empire of alien conquerors — with the help of five mechanized lions that combine to form a robot.    Since the first series, the franchise spawned three television series produced outside Japan: the 3D CG Voltron: The Third Dimension in 1998, the 2D Voltron Force in 2011, and Dreamworks and Netflix's Voltron: Legendary Defender.    The eighth and final season of the Voltron: Legendary Defender animated series premiered on Netflix in December 2018. Netflix is streaming 12 episodes of the original Voltron series under the title Voltron 84.    The Hollywood Reporter stated that Netflix is not among the companies bidding for the upcoming live-action project.      Studios previously attempted a live-action Hollywood project for the franchise in 2007 and then in 2012, but neither project moved forward.

News The Hollywood Reporter: Hollywood Studios Shop for Live-Action Voltron Project   posted on 2022-04-03 18:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Rawson Marshall Thurber would direct, co-write script with Ellen Shanman     The Hollywood Reporter reported on March 23 that Warner Bros., Universal, Amazon, and a few other studios are shopping for the rights to a live-action Voltron project. Rawson Marshall Thurber (Red Notice) would co-write the script with Ellen Shanman and Thurber would also direct.    Todd Lieberman, David Hoberman (Beauty and the Beast 2017), and World Events Productions' Bob Koplar (Voltron: Legendary Defender) would produce the project.    World Events Productions, Ltd. (WEP) and the late Peter O'Keefe adapted the first 1984-1985 Voltron television series from two Toei Animation robot anime: King of Beasts Golion and Armored Fleet Dairugger XV. Both Golion and the first Voltron story centered on young pilots who fight against an empire of alien conquerors — with the help of five mechanized lions that combine to form a robot.    Since the first series, the franchise spawned three television series produced outside Japan: the 3D CG Voltron: The Third Dimension in 1998, the 2D Voltron Force in 2011, and Dreamworks and Netflix's Voltron: Legendary Defender.    The eighth and final season of the Voltron: Legendary Defender animated series premiered on Netflix in December 2018. Netflix is streaming 12 episodes of the original Voltron series under the title Voltron 84.    The Hollywood Reporter stated that Netflix is not among the companies bidding for the upcoming live-action project.      Studios previously attempted a live-action Hollywood project for the franchise in 2007 and then in 2012, but neither project moved forward.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest.

Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 25th 2022       My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World!  GN 1                     Synopsis:             Yuji Sano is working overtime again for a company he recognizes is terrible to him when a strange pop-up appears on his computer. The pop-up asks him if he's willing to accept his summons to another world, and, thinking it's a virus, Yuji ignores it…which is taken as consent, and the next thing he knows he's in a fantasy world taming slimes. Half-convinced it's a dream brought on by overwork, Yuji decides to just go with it, but is it really that easy to be a laid-back summoned hero? Probably not, but Yuji doesn't feel like he has much other choice…      Review:         Synopsis:        Yuji Sano is working overtime again for a company he recognizes is terrible to him when a strange pop-up appears on his computer. The pop-up asks him if he's willing to accept his summons to another world, and, thinking it's a virus, Yuji ignores it…which is taken as consent, and the next thing he knows he's in a fantasy world taming slimes. Half-convinced it's a dream brought on by overwork, Yuji decides to just go with it, but is it really that easy to be a laid-back summoned hero? Probably not, but Yuji doesn't feel like he has much other choice…     Review:            As you can guess from the title, there's a pretty good chance that you've read, watched, or played some version of this story before. My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World! doesn't leave much to the imagination, and yes, it more or less does what it says on the tin. Yuji Sano is, in fact, summoned to a fantasy world to begin his isekai life, and he does bumble into gaining a second character class to go alongside his initial “tamer.” But Yuji's completely unaware that this is at all weird in the world he's been summoned to, and that looks like it's going to cause some problems for him.    Yuji himself is a bit different from the run-of-the-mill isekai protagonists. He's a working adult, which in itself isn't that unusual, but he's also remarkably blasé about the entire situation he finds himself in. There's no real sense that he's anything beyond tangentially aware of isekai stories, much in the same way that someone might be aware of Spiderman movies without having ever bothered to see one – he knows they exist, but he's never been particularly interested in consuming them. In fact, what he's most invested in is his job, even though he knows it's not good for him or allowing him to live a healthy lifestyle. In fact, he spends the first part of his new fantasy existence worrying about waking up to get home to finish up his work; that he's been rescued from it never even occurs to him.    If he has in fact been deliberately “rescued” from his life, there's no real indication of it yet, although it remains a tantalizing possibility. Mostly this is due to the manner in which he was summoned: a pop-up on his computer while he was working like a dog. As such, there is a good chance that he is summoned by some deity who was watching him work himself into the grave – Yuji notes that if he's collapsed from overwork and is in the hospital dreaming, it wouldn't be the first time. If the pop-up, with its warning that failing to click either “yes” or “no” would result in silence being taken for consent, is in fact an attempt to save him, it could have been triggered by his excessive amount of time working and a hedged bet that he would do precisely what he did – assume that it's a virus and ignore it to reboot his computer, resulting in him being forcefully removed from his current life.    In any event, Yuji's initial reactions to his new situation are somewhat extreme. After he concludes that he must be dreaming and notices a status window floating in front of him, he decides that he really needs to get back home to that paperwork, and that the easiest way to do it is to die “in-game.” It's a somewhat logical but also rather upsetting decision on his part, because he absolutely sets off to find a way to die. What's unsettling is that he doesn't seem to care if he's wrong, and that if he really dies, that's just how it goes. More than anything else, this shows us why some unknown deity may be going to so much trouble to save him, because Yuji's already reached the point where it doesn't much matter to him if he lives or dies.    Fortunately for both Yuji and the continued story, he instead finds himself adapting to his new life, even as he recognizes that the “game mechanics” seem very, very broken. On the downside, with Yuji setting off to tame slimes, use slimes, and find a way to earn money for food, the story gets awfully familiar very quickly. Even the slime angle is hardly novel, and when you add in an adventurers' guild and Yuji's awesome new powers, everything starts to reek of the overfamiliar. Yuji's attitude is something of a saving grace, because he's just so remarkably unconcerned about how things are playing out that it makes him interesting by virtue of being so apparently bored with the entire situation. They can make him live an isekai life, but they can't make him like it.    For the most part, Yuji is the only character in this story. He has his many, many slimes and he meets a nice, burly adventurer, but generally speaking he's just puttering around interacting with isekai staples, like the guild girl and the guild examiner. On the one hand, this shows how totally uninvested Yuji is in his new life; on the other, it can make for something of a slow read. The manga is adapted from the light novel of the same name, and there is a slight feeling that it may have worked better in novel form, if only because the actual action of the story might start a bit sooner. The book is a little dull; not boring, because there's certainly enough happening, but just not as interesting as it could be due to a paucity of actual story events in the volume.    It is, however, perfectly fine reading. PONJEA's art is good enough (although the goofy faces during the guild exam feel a bit out of left field comparatively), and Shinkoshoto's text is marginally more interesting than in their other work to see an English release, the manga version of The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest. Then again, based on both of these works, it also seems fair to say that building tension isn't one of their strong suits; it just works better here than in the other series. But it does beg the question of how invested we can be in Yuji's story when he barely seems to care about what happens to himself.             Grade:      Overall : C+ Story : C Art : B-  + Yuji's understated reactions give the story a slight edge, most of the slimes have unique identifying features. − Yuji's understated reactions can backfire in making him uninterested in his own story, laid-back approach doesn't create much story tension.            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Original creator: Shinkoshoto   Original Character Design: Huuka Kazabana   Art: PONJEA   Full encyclopedia details aboutTensei Kenja no Isekai Life (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Yuji Sano is working overtime again for a company he recognizes is terrible to him when a strange pop-up appears on his computer. The pop-up asks him if he's willing to accept his summons to another world, and, thinking it's a virus, Yuji ignores it…which is taken as consent, and the next thing he knows he's in a fantasy world taming slimes. Half-convinced it's a dream brought on by overwork, Yuji decides to just go with it, but is it really that easy to be a laid-back summoned hero? Probably not, but Yuji doesn't feel like he has much other choice…      Review:         Synopsis:        Yuji Sano is working overtime again for a company he recognizes is terrible to him when a strange pop-up appears on his computer. The pop-up asks him if he's willing to accept his summons to another world, and, thinking it's a virus, Yuji ignores it…which is taken as consent, and the next thing he knows he's in a fantasy world taming slimes. Half-convinced it's a dream brought on by overwork, Yuji decides to just go with it, but is it really that easy to be a laid-back summoned hero? Probably not, but Yuji doesn't feel like he has much other choice…     Review:            As you can guess from the title, there's a pretty good chance that you've read, watched, or played some version of this story before. My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World! doesn't leave much to the imagination, and yes, it more or less does what it says on the tin. Yuji Sano is, in fact, summoned to a fantasy world to begin his isekai life, and he does bumble into gaining a second character class to go alongside his initial “tamer.” But Yuji's completely unaware that this is at all weird in the world he's been summoned to, and that looks like it's going to cause some problems for him.    Yuji himself is a bit different from the run-of-the-mill isekai protagonists. He's a working adult, which in itself isn't that unusual, but he's also remarkably blasé about the entire situation he finds himself in. There's no real sense that he's anything beyond tangentially aware of isekai stories, much in the same way that someone might be aware of Spiderman movies without having ever bothered to see one – he knows they exist, but he's never been particularly interested in consuming them. In fact, what he's most invested in is his job, even though he knows it's not good for him or allowing him to live a healthy lifestyle. In fact, he spends the first part of his new fantasy existence worrying about waking up to get home to finish up his work; that he's been rescued from it never even occurs to him.    If he has in fact been deliberately “rescued” from his life, there's no real indication of it yet, although it remains a tantalizing possibility. Mostly this is due to the manner in which he was summoned: a pop-up on his computer while he was working like a dog. As such, there is a good chance that he is summoned by some deity who was watching him work himself into the grave – Yuji notes that if he's collapsed from overwork and is in the hospital dreaming, it wouldn't be the first time. If the pop-up, with its warning that failing to click either “yes” or “no” would result in silence being taken for consent, is in fact an attempt to save him, it could have been triggered by his excessive amount of time working and a hedged bet that he would do precisely what he did – assume that it's a virus and ignore it to reboot his computer, resulting in him being forcefully removed from his current life.    In any event, Yuji's initial reactions to his new situation are somewhat extreme. After he concludes that he must be dreaming and notices a status window floating in front of him, he decides that he really needs to get back home to that paperwork, and that the easiest way to do it is to die “in-game.” It's a somewhat logical but also rather upsetting decision on his part, because he absolutely sets off to find a way to die. What's unsettling is that he doesn't seem to care if he's wrong, and that if he really dies, that's just how it goes. More than anything else, this shows us why some unknown deity may be going to so much trouble to save him, because Yuji's already reached the point where it doesn't much matter to him if he lives or dies.    Fortunately for both Yuji and the continued story, he instead finds himself adapting to his new life, even as he recognizes that the “game mechanics” seem very, very broken. On the downside, with Yuji setting off to tame slimes, use slimes, and find a way to earn money for food, the story gets awfully familiar very quickly. Even the slime angle is hardly novel, and when you add in an adventurers' guild and Yuji's awesome new powers, everything starts to reek of the overfamiliar. Yuji's attitude is something of a saving grace, because he's just so remarkably unconcerned about how things are playing out that it makes him interesting by virtue of being so apparently bored with the entire situation. They can make him live an isekai life, but they can't make him like it.    For the most part, Yuji is the only character in this story. He has his many, many slimes and he meets a nice, burly adventurer, but generally speaking he's just puttering around interacting with isekai staples, like the guild girl and the guild examiner. On the one hand, this shows how totally uninvested Yuji is in his new life; on the other, it can make for something of a slow read. The manga is adapted from the light novel of the same name, and there is a slight feeling that it may have worked better in novel form, if only because the actual action of the story might start a bit sooner. The book is a little dull; not boring, because there's certainly enough happening, but just not as interesting as it could be due to a paucity of actual story events in the volume.    It is, however, perfectly fine reading. PONJEA's art is good enough (although the goofy faces during the guild exam feel a bit out of left field comparatively), and Shinkoshoto's text is marginally more interesting than in their other work to see an English release, the manga version of The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest. Then again, based on both of these works, it also seems fair to say that building tension isn't one of their strong suits; it just works better here than in the other series. But it does beg the question of how invested we can be in Yuji's story when he barely seems to care about what happens to himself.             Grade:      Overall : C+ Story : C Art : B-  + Yuji's understated reactions give the story a slight edge, most of the slimes have unique identifying features. − Yuji's understated reactions can backfire in making him uninterested in his own story, laid-back approach doesn't create much story tension.            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Original creator: Shinkoshoto   Original Character Design: Huuka Kazabana   Art: PONJEA   Full encyclopedia details aboutTensei Kenja no Isekai Life (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 25th 2022       My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World!  GN 1                     Synopsis:             Yuji Sano is working overtime again for a company he recognizes is terrible to him when a strange pop-up appears on his computer. The pop-up asks him if he's willing to accept his summons to another world, and, thinking it's a virus, Yuji ignores it…which is taken as consent, and the next thing he knows he's in a fantasy world taming slimes. Half-convinced it's a dream brought on by overwork, Yuji decides to just go with it, but is it really that easy to be a laid-back summoned hero? Probably not, but Yuji doesn't feel like he has much other choice…      Review:         Synopsis:        Yuji Sano is working overtime again for a company he recognizes is terrible to him when a strange pop-up appears on his computer. The pop-up asks him if he's willing to accept his summons to another world, and, thinking it's a virus, Yuji ignores it…which is taken as consent, and the next thing he knows he's in a fantasy world taming slimes. Half-convinced it's a dream brought on by overwork, Yuji decides to just go with it, but is it really that easy to be a laid-back summoned hero? Probably not, but Yuji doesn't feel like he has much other choice…     Review:            As you can guess from the title, there's a pretty good chance that you've read, watched, or played some version of this story before. My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World! doesn't leave much to the imagination, and yes, it more or less does what it says on the tin. Yuji Sano is, in fact, summoned to a fantasy world to begin his isekai life, and he does bumble into gaining a second character class to go alongside his initial “tamer.” But Yuji's completely unaware that this is at all weird in the world he's been summoned to, and that looks like it's going to cause some problems for him.    Yuji himself is a bit different from the run-of-the-mill isekai protagonists. He's a working adult, which in itself isn't that unusual, but he's also remarkably blasé about the entire situation he finds himself in. There's no real sense that he's anything beyond tangentially aware of isekai stories, much in the same way that someone might be aware of Spiderman movies without having ever bothered to see one – he knows they exist, but he's never been particularly interested in consuming them. In fact, what he's most invested in is his job, even though he knows it's not good for him or allowing him to live a healthy lifestyle. In fact, he spends the first part of his new fantasy existence worrying about waking up to get home to finish up his work; that he's been rescued from it never even occurs to him.    If he has in fact been deliberately “rescued” from his life, there's no real indication of it yet, although it remains a tantalizing possibility. Mostly this is due to the manner in which he was summoned: a pop-up on his computer while he was working like a dog. As such, there is a good chance that he is summoned by some deity who was watching him work himself into the grave – Yuji notes that if he's collapsed from overwork and is in the hospital dreaming, it wouldn't be the first time. If the pop-up, with its warning that failing to click either “yes” or “no” would result in silence being taken for consent, is in fact an attempt to save him, it could have been triggered by his excessive amount of time working and a hedged bet that he would do precisely what he did – assume that it's a virus and ignore it to reboot his computer, resulting in him being forcefully removed from his current life.    In any event, Yuji's initial reactions to his new situation are somewhat extreme. After he concludes that he must be dreaming and notices a status window floating in front of him, he decides that he really needs to get back home to that paperwork, and that the easiest way to do it is to die “in-game.” It's a somewhat logical but also rather upsetting decision on his part, because he absolutely sets off to find a way to die. What's unsettling is that he doesn't seem to care if he's wrong, and that if he really dies, that's just how it goes. More than anything else, this shows us why some unknown deity may be going to so much trouble to save him, because Yuji's already reached the point where it doesn't much matter to him if he lives or dies.    Fortunately for both Yuji and the continued story, he instead finds himself adapting to his new life, even as he recognizes that the “game mechanics” seem very, very broken. On the downside, with Yuji setting off to tame slimes, use slimes, and find a way to earn money for food, the story gets awfully familiar very quickly. Even the slime angle is hardly novel, and when you add in an adventurers' guild and Yuji's awesome new powers, everything starts to reek of the overfamiliar. Yuji's attitude is something of a saving grace, because he's just so remarkably unconcerned about how things are playing out that it makes him interesting by virtue of being so apparently bored with the entire situation. They can make him live an isekai life, but they can't make him like it.    For the most part, Yuji is the only character in this story. He has his many, many slimes and he meets a nice, burly adventurer, but generally speaking he's just puttering around interacting with isekai staples, like the guild girl and the guild examiner. On the one hand, this shows how totally uninvested Yuji is in his new life; on the other, it can make for something of a slow read. The manga is adapted from the light novel of the same name, and there is a slight feeling that it may have worked better in novel form, if only because the actual action of the story might start a bit sooner. The book is a little dull; not boring, because there's certainly enough happening, but just not as interesting as it could be due to a paucity of actual story events in the volume.    It is, however, perfectly fine reading. PONJEA's art is good enough (although the goofy faces during the guild exam feel a bit out of left field comparatively), and Shinkoshoto's text is marginally more interesting than in their other work to see an English release, the manga version of The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest. Then again, based on both of these works, it also seems fair to say that building tension isn't one of their strong suits; it just works better here than in the other series. But it does beg the question of how invested we can be in Yuji's story when he barely seems to care about what happens to himself.             Grade:      Overall : C+ Story : C Art : B-  + Yuji's understated reactions give the story a slight edge, most of the slimes have unique identifying features. − Yuji's understated reactions can backfire in making him uninterested in his own story, laid-back approach doesn't create much story tension.            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Original creator: Shinkoshoto   Original Character Design: Huuka Kazabana   Art: PONJEA   Full encyclopedia details aboutTensei Kenja no Isekai Life (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

All I can say to that is that MAPPA and Kodansha both better have a game plan for when its fans inevitably charge them for all of the anti-anxiety medication they'll need to be taking if they end up having to wait a whole extra year or two for that movie to get made.             It comes down to how many episodes this ""final"" Final Season has,as currently we're seeing one chapter per episode (plus the OP's visuals and that song) point towards movie.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119 for context.            This is interesting. I was still under the impression that may be they will have everything done this time. But who would pass an opportunity to make more money with a theatrical release for the final finale of this literally titan franchise?

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

We're nearing the end of one of the biggest anime giants and it truly feels like it, and I still find it incredible how far Attack on Titan has come since season 1.   MAPPA did an amazing job with these first two episodes. If I had to complain about something, I'd probably say the recap in episode 2 was a little too long, but other than that, I enjoyed the ride the whole way through.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice.

Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group      ",positive,en,{}

Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group    ",positive,en,{}

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1.
