Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.
