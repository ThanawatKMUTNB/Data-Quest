Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.5            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.    Rating:                 Akebi's Sailor Uniform is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform. When they're not writing and reviewing, you can find them on their  Twitter or on their  Instagram where she's always up to something.   <prevEpisode 1‒2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episodes 6-7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episodes 10-11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (81 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.5            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.    Rating:                 Akebi's Sailor Uniform is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.5            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.5            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

Community score: 4.5            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school.

However, maybe with a marvelous dress, a marvelous stage, and a marvelous prince ... The new Cinderella story follows these small idols and their small rookie producer.

I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.      Back to top                  Nyren    Joined: 07 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 663       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:50 pm            I can straight up say that if you thought there was anything special about Sekai, there isn't. His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

In the TCG and gacha community, Bandai is often referred to as one of the worst companies to handle gaming.

Gundam Build Fighters Try was good, but not as good as the original GBF.   Gundam Build Divers was really disappointing.   Gundam Build Divers Re: Rise was better than GBD, but still not as good as GBF.

This caused many card shops to go under. A lot of store owners and distributors in the west hate bandai with a burning passion. Bandai was so incompetent at tcgs, they killed the naruto tcg at narutos peak popularity. If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

His design is just similar to Reiji.            What's special about Sekai, and the reason to like him, is his connection to Domon. It's paper thin yes, but it's enough to make G Gundam fans happy.   I agree that Try isn't as good as the original GBF, but it still has some great episodes like the one where Sekai gets thrashed by a raw build Gunpla (no painting, etc.).   I didn't bother with Divers or Re:Rise, and it sounds like there isn't much reason to. But that said, what makes GBF great is how enthusiastic and shameless it is about being what it is: a toy commercial.

I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.      Back to top                  Nyren    Joined: 07 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 663       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:50 pm            I can straight up say that if you thought there was anything special about Sekai, there isn't. His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

In the TCG and gacha community, Bandai is often referred to as one of the worst companies to handle gaming.

Gundam Build Fighters Try was good, but not as good as the original GBF.   Gundam Build Divers was really disappointing.

This caused many card shops to go under. A lot of store owners and distributors in the west hate bandai with a burning passion. Bandai was so incompetent at tcgs, they killed the naruto tcg at narutos peak popularity. If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

His design is just similar to Reiji.            What's special about Sekai, and the reason to like him, is his connection to Domon. It's paper thin yes, but it's enough to make G Gundam fans happy.   I agree that Try isn't as good as the original GBF, but it still has some great episodes like the one where Sekai gets thrashed by a raw build Gunpla (no painting, etc.).   I didn't bother with Divers or Re:Rise, and it sounds like there isn't much reason to. But that said, what makes GBF great is how enthusiastic and shameless it is about being what it is: a toy commercial.

I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.

His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

In the TCG and gacha community, Bandai is often referred to as one of the worst companies to handle gaming.

Gundam Build Fighters Try was good, but not as good as the original GBF.   Gundam Build Divers was really disappointing.   Gundam Build Divers Re: Rise was better than GBD, but still not as good as GBF.

This caused many card shops to go under. A lot of store owners and distributors in the west hate bandai with a burning passion. Bandai was so incompetent at tcgs, they killed the naruto tcg at narutos peak popularity. If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

His design is just similar to Reiji.            What's special about Sekai, and the reason to like him, is his connection to Domon. It's paper thin yes, but it's enough to make G Gundam fans happy.   I agree that Try isn't as good as the original GBF, but it still has some great episodes like the one where Sekai gets thrashed by a raw build Gunpla (no painting, etc.).   I didn't bother with Divers or Re:Rise, and it sounds like there isn't much reason to. But that said, what makes GBF great is how enthusiastic and shameless it is about being what it is: a toy commercial.

So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.

His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

In the TCG and gacha community, Bandai is often referred to as one of the worst companies to handle gaming.

Gundam Build Fighters Try was good, but not as good as the original GBF.   Gundam Build Divers was really disappointing.   Gundam Build Divers Re: Rise was better than GBD, but still not as good as GBF.

This caused many card shops to go under. A lot of store owners and distributors in the west hate bandai with a burning passion. Bandai was so incompetent at tcgs, they killed the naruto tcg at narutos peak popularity. If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

His design is just similar to Reiji.            What's special about Sekai, and the reason to like him, is his connection to Domon. It's paper thin yes, but it's enough to make G Gundam fans happy.   I agree that Try isn't as good as the original GBF, but it still has some great episodes like the one where Sekai gets thrashed by a raw build Gunpla (no painting, etc.).   I didn't bother with Divers or Re:Rise, and it sounds like there isn't much reason to. But that said, what makes GBF great is how enthusiastic and shameless it is about being what it is: a toy commercial.

For starters, “lolicon” or “roricon” is short for “Lolita Complex.” “Lolita” as a term for an under-age girl comes from the book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.

Justin looks back on old video rooms and industry panels to find out. ―  Fred asked: I've only been going to conventions for the past year or so, and I'm curious how they've evolved over time.
