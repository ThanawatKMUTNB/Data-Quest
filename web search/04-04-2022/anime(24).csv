Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

News Ablaze Licenses Magical Beast Sherbert Manga   posted on 2022-04-01 00:59 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga launches worldwide in 2023    Ablaze announced on Thursday that it has licensed the Magical Beast Sherbert manga, an adaptation of the anime series based on K-LINE's Sherbert (Mahō Shojū Sherbert) character. The company will release the manga physically and digitally worldwide in 2023. Diamond Comic and Diamond Book Distributors are distributing the print version.     Rai☆ is writing the story, and Mochiusagi is drawing the manga.    K-LINE, a company that makes kigurumi and fur suits, designed the Sherbert character for its Showcase line. The  ""Sherbert Shenanigans!"" YouTube channel describes the character's story:    Sherbert is a magical creature from another realm called Lylasia, where different species of magical creatures are locked in a Magical Beast War. Immature and infinitely curious, Sherbert accidentally triggers a portal and ends up in our world. Without any knowledge about our world and our ways, he vows to become a hero here...and battles other magical creatures who make their way across the rift.   Takashi Yamamoto (Final Approach, Jewelpet Twinkle, Onigiri) is directing the anime at ZEXCS (ZEXCS also works on the animated segments of the videos on the ""Sherbert Shenanigans!"" YouTube channel.). K-LINE is also credited for the original character design. Sherberts' Productions is credited as writer and producer.

Takashi Yamamoto (Final Approach, Jewelpet Twinkle, Onigiri) is directing the anime at ZEXCS (ZEXCS also works on the animated segments of the videos on the ""Sherbert Shenanigans!""

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes.

It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes.

We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion.

Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.

Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.

Thank you for crediting the 'reader' who did all the legwork to bring this scandal to light. Katrina is not a nobody: her translations/localisations are very high quality (eg Interspecies Reviewers, O Maidens in your Savage Season, Kageki Shoujo, Dragon House Hunting).   For whatever reason, ANN seem inclined to dismiss her as 'a reader', probably because they only looked at the BookLive release, which is a ridiculously corporate piece of spin. Had ANN done their due diligence they'd know this is a much bigger deal than 'translation errors'.      Back to top                  Kendall TV    Joined: 02 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 30       Posted: Sun Apr 03, 2022 5:29 am            Once again, we have a company that can easily afford to pay more for a quality product, yet decide to try to go the cheap route anyway.   By hiring an agency, BookLive certainly saved money. And you can be sure the agency, Digital Dragon, didn't pay a good wage to the translator. It looks like the agency contracts with Indonesian talent. I've heard of agencies paying translators living in first-world countries 100 yen per page, which is basically nothing. And with the cost of living in Indonesia being extremely low, I wouldn't be surprised if the agency paid their RoK translator a fraction of that. No wonder the translator didn't give a crap about the work and was content with copying the already terrible scanlation. It's a sad and pathetic situation all around.   BookLive could have hired a well-known translator who has a strong page count and resume under their belt. Yes, it would have cost significantly more. But what's the real cost of BookLive's bad decision? I'm willing to bet most English manga readers have never heard of BookLive, and now their first encounter with the company is this disgraceful news.   I think everybody should take a look at the doc Katrina Leonoudakis made where she did a line-by-line comparison of BookLive's and the scanlator's versions because it really shows how dirty the translator did this series.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1510072654731964418   Somebody out there is bound to think that the scanlators agreed for their translation to be used by Digital Dragon or BookLive, but Katrina also found out that that's not the case.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1509898055453081601      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Thank you for crediting the 'reader' who did all the legwork to bring this scandal to light. Katrina is not a nobody: her translations/localisations are very high quality (eg Interspecies Reviewers, O Maidens in your Savage Season, Kageki Shoujo, Dragon House Hunting).   For whatever reason, ANN seem inclined to dismiss her as 'a reader', probably because they only looked at the BookLive release, which is a ridiculously corporate piece of spin. Had ANN done their due diligence they'd know this is a much bigger deal than 'translation errors'.      Back to top                  Kendall TV    Joined: 02 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 30       Posted: Sun Apr 03, 2022 5:29 am            Once again, we have a company that can easily afford to pay more for a quality product, yet decide to try to go the cheap route anyway.   By hiring an agency, BookLive certainly saved money. And you can be sure the agency, Digital Dragon, didn't pay a good wage to the translator. It looks like the agency contracts with Indonesian talent. I've heard of agencies paying translators living in first-world countries 100 yen per page, which is basically nothing. And with the cost of living in Indonesia being extremely low, I wouldn't be surprised if the agency paid their RoK translator a fraction of that. No wonder the translator didn't give a crap about the work and was content with copying the already terrible scanlation. It's a sad and pathetic situation all around.   BookLive could have hired a well-known translator who has a strong page count and resume under their belt. Yes, it would have cost significantly more. But what's the real cost of BookLive's bad decision? I'm willing to bet most English manga readers have never heard of BookLive, and now their first encounter with the company is this disgraceful news.   I think everybody should take a look at the doc Katrina Leonoudakis made where she did a line-by-line comparison of BookLive's and the scanlator's versions because it really shows how dirty the translator did this series.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1510072654731964418   Somebody out there is bound to think that the scanlators agreed for their translation to be used by Digital Dragon or BookLive, but Katrina also found out that that's not the case.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1509898055453081601      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Thank you for crediting the 'reader' who did all the legwork to bring this scandal to light. Katrina is not a nobody: her translations/localisations are very high quality (eg Interspecies Reviewers, O Maidens in your Savage Season, Kageki Shoujo, Dragon House Hunting).   For whatever reason, ANN seem inclined to dismiss her as 'a reader', probably because they only looked at the BookLive release, which is a ridiculously corporate piece of spin. Had ANN done their due diligence they'd know this is a much bigger deal than 'translation errors'.      Back to top                  Kendall TV    Joined: 02 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 30       Posted: Sun Apr 03, 2022 5:29 am            Once again, we have a company that can easily afford to pay more for a quality product, yet decide to try to go the cheap route anyway.   By hiring an agency, BookLive certainly saved money. And you can be sure the agency, Digital Dragon, didn't pay a good wage to the translator. It looks like the agency contracts with Indonesian talent. I've heard of agencies paying translators living in first-world countries 100 yen per page, which is basically nothing. And with the cost of living in Indonesia being extremely low, I wouldn't be surprised if the agency paid their RoK translator a fraction of that. No wonder the translator didn't give a crap about the work and was content with copying the already terrible scanlation. It's a sad and pathetic situation all around.   BookLive could have hired a well-known translator who has a strong page count and resume under their belt. Yes, it would have cost significantly more. But what's the real cost of BookLive's bad decision? I'm willing to bet most English manga readers have never heard of BookLive, and now their first encounter with the company is this disgraceful news.   I think everybody should take a look at the doc Katrina Leonoudakis made where she did a line-by-line comparison of BookLive's and the scanlator's versions because it really shows how dirty the translator did this series.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1510072654731964418   Somebody out there is bound to think that the scanlators agreed for their translation to be used by Digital Dragon or BookLive, but Katrina also found out that that's not the case.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1509898055453081601      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Thank you for crediting the 'reader' who did all the legwork to bring this scandal to light. Katrina is not a nobody: her translations/localisations are very high quality (eg Interspecies Reviewers, O Maidens in your Savage Season, Kageki Shoujo, Dragon House Hunting).   For whatever reason, ANN seem inclined to dismiss her as 'a reader', probably because they only looked at the BookLive release, which is a ridiculously corporate piece of spin. Had ANN done their due diligence they'd know this is a much bigger deal than 'translation errors'.      Back to top                  Kendall TV    Joined: 02 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 30       Posted: Sun Apr 03, 2022 5:29 am            Once again, we have a company that can easily afford to pay more for a quality product, yet decide to try to go the cheap route anyway.   By hiring an agency, BookLive certainly saved money. And you can be sure the agency, Digital Dragon, didn't pay a good wage to the translator. It looks like the agency contracts with Indonesian talent. I've heard of agencies paying translators living in first-world countries 100 yen per page, which is basically nothing. And with the cost of living in Indonesia being extremely low, I wouldn't be surprised if the agency paid their RoK translator a fraction of that. No wonder the translator didn't give a crap about the work and was content with copying the already terrible scanlation. It's a sad and pathetic situation all around.   BookLive could have hired a well-known translator who has a strong page count and resume under their belt. Yes, it would have cost significantly more. But what's the real cost of BookLive's bad decision? I'm willing to bet most English manga readers have never heard of BookLive, and now their first encounter with the company is this disgraceful news.   I think everybody should take a look at the doc Katrina Leonoudakis made where she did a line-by-line comparison of BookLive's and the scanlator's versions because it really shows how dirty the translator did this series.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1510072654731964418   Somebody out there is bound to think that the scanlators agreed for their translation to be used by Digital Dragon or BookLive, but Katrina also found out that that's not the case.   https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1509898055453081601      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets. Otherwise, catch him chatting about trash and treasure alike on This Week in Anime.  <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11     discuss this in the forum (101 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to World's End Harem Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

04-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/world-end-harem/episode-11/.183813,Episode 11 - World's End Harem - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men.
