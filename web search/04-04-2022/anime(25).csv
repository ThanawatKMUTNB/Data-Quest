The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride.

However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride.

Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

News The Prince of Tennis II: U-17 World Cup Anime Casts Tomokazu Seki as Entire Greek Team   posted on 2022-04-01 20:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Seki voices all 7 Hellenic Republic members in 1st TV anime in 10 years    The official website for the Shin Tennis no Ōji-sama U-17 World Cup (The Prince of Tennis II: U-17 World Cup) anime series announced that Tomokazu Seki is voicing every member of the Greek team. The anime's Twitter account acknowledges that the surprising news sounds like an April Fool's joke, but insists that it is real.         The seven Hellenic Republic team members Seki is voicing are:    Zeus Iliopoulos (as previously announced)   Thalatta Hercules    Papadopoulos Evangelos    Vulcan Laërtius    Hermes Kounellis    Orion Stephanopoulos    Aporon (Apollon) Stephanopoulos      The anime will be the first anime in the franchise in about a decade.    The new series features the returning cast members:     Junko Minagawa as Ryōma Echizen   Ryotaro Okiayu as Kunimitsu Tezuka   Hiroki Yasumoto as Hōō Byōdōin   Junichi Suwabe as Keigo Atobe   Sachiko Nagai as Seiichi Yukimura   Yoshimasa Hosoya as Kuranosuke Shiraishi  Tarusuke Shingaki as Eishirō Kite   Mamoru Miyano as Ryōga Echizen    New cast members include:     Hiroki Takahashi as Ralph Rhinehart   Kenjiro Tsuda as Dodo Obando   Takayuki Kondō as Kiko Balentien   Naru Kawamoto as Alan Hopkins   Masaya Onosaka as Rocky Meredith   Kohei Kiyasu as Maxwell   Kentarō Tone as Jürgen Borisovich Volk   Tomokazu Seki as Zeus Iliopoulos   Subaru Kimura as J. J. Dorgias   Kazuyuki Okitsu as Alexander Amadeus   Natsuki Hanae as Prince Ludovic Chardard    Keiichiro Kawaguchi (ISLAND) is returning from the last 2D anime, The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future, to direct the new series at Studio KAI and M.S.C, and Mitsutaka Hirota (Anime-Gataris, Nanbaka) is again superivising the scripts. Akiharu Ishii (Blood+, Ultramarine Magmell) is back to design the characters and serve as chief animation director.    Singer Yoshiki Ezaki and hip-hop duo Bleecker Chrome are collaborating for the anime's opening theme song ""I can fly."" TeniPri Artistars will perform the ending theme song ""Dear Friends.""    The new anime will premiere on TV Tokyo in July.    Takeshi Konomi serialized The Prince of Tennis manga's original run in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1999 to 2008. The manga follows middle school tennis player Ryōma Echizen as he battles rivals to reach the national tournament. That original manga inspired a 2001-2005 television anime, two anime feature films and a theatrical short, various video anime projects, a live-action film, a live-action television series in China, and a popular stage musical series.    Konomi then launched The Prince of Tennis II manga series in Shueisha's Jump SQ. magazine in 2009.
