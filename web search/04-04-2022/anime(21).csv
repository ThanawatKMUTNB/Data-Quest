Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          29 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 29 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          35 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 35 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          92 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 92 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          46 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 46 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1012   Mar  2, 04:30 621 comments                 anime    I would not go so far as to say that Wano is as bad as Dressrosa in regards to fight pacing and having too much going on, but it's still hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff happening.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          29 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 29 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          35 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 35 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          92 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 92 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          46 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 46 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1012   Mar  2, 04:30 621 comments                 anime    I would not go so far as to say that Wano is as bad as Dressrosa in regards to fight pacing and having too much going on, but it's still hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff happening.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Re:Dive, is a roller coaster.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 02:30 58 comments                 anime    This entire episode is a single-minded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 12   Mar 30, 00:30 42 comments                 anime    Now we approach the winter of our discontent as we see Richard turn to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle.                    ep. review          29 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 11   Mar 29, 02:30 29 comments                 anime    Miss Kuroitsu has routinely turned in great comedic episodes, but this one felt exceptionally mediocre for a series approaching its finale.                    ep. review          125 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 12   Mar 29, 01:30 125 comments                 anime    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 28, 23:30 341 comments                 anime    This episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along and makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.                    ep. review          92 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 23   Mar 26, 05:30 92 comments                 anime    Mikhaïl's machinations are pushing Noé and Vanitas into a position they may not be able to recover from. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          29 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 29 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          35 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 35 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          92 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 92 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          46 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 46 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1012   Mar  2, 04:30 621 comments                 anime    I would not go so far as to say that Wano is as bad as Dressrosa in regards to fight pacing and having too much going on, but it's still hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff happening.

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.                    ep. review          35 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 04:30 35 comments                 anime    We have one final episode left and I’m starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won’t be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 03:30 45 comments                 anime    Here we are at the true proper conclusion of the land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    The series often showed that while the world includes unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode.

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          92 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 92 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          46 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 46 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1012   Mar  2, 04:30 621 comments                 anime    I would not go so far as to say that Wano is as bad as Dressrosa in regards to fight pacing and having too much going on, but it's still hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff happening.

I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode. It's subtle, almost mundane, yet is the cream of slice of life this season because of the emotionality of Komichi's world.                    ep. review          46 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 00:30 46 comments                 anime    Eri reveals her big plot and what set her on the path of villainy this week.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ SERIES FINALE   Mar 25, 23:30 107 comments                 anime    Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 03:30 18 comments                 anime    Slow Loop brings us a Koi-centric episode that's all about reminiscing while in the moment.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 02:30 19 comments                 anime    Our lord and savior Lord Ojiro is ready to make an appearance after definitely doing a murder, but first, it Minato Tribe must be deemed worthy enough to face off against our bemasked liege.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 01:30 48 comments                 anime    Now that Vizzd and Maid-chan have dropped the act and revealed their evil intentions, I'm glad to report they're just as funny – and stupid – as our heroes.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 10   Mar 25, 00:30 14 comments                 anime    At this point you don't need me to keep coming in and telling you that Tokyo 24th Ward's sociopolitical analyses are as fundamentally broken as the corpse-powered computer at the center of its narrative.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    The season's climactic battle against the reanimated and Kurokawa-possessed Tetsujin continues into its second week, with both predictable and surprising developments.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 00:30 89 comments                 anime    Now that we're in the middle of the final arc of the season, we get introduced to another flaw of our titular genius prince: his lack of experience.                    ep. review          125 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 23, 01:30 125 comments                 anime    How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom addresses a refugee crisis and childbirth in one episode with mixed results.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake.

Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Interest Neko Works Announces Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game on April Fool's Day   posted on 2022-04-01 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    It's April Fool's Day in Japan, so take any announcements with a certain degree of suspicion. Neko Works, the creators of the popular Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages. The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls.     #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The hypothetical game's opening video is streaming on YouTube and includes the theme song ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira.      Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

Interest Neko Works Announces Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game on April Fool's Day   posted on 2022-04-01 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    It's April Fool's Day in Japan, so take any announcements with a certain degree of suspicion. Neko Works, the creators of the popular Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages. The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls.     #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The hypothetical game's opening video is streaming on YouTube and includes the theme song ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira.      Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

Kouki Uchiyama plays Ruō Mori, and Kaede Hondo plays Miyako Godai.    Munehisa Sakai (Zombie Land Saga) is directing the anime at MAPPA, and Yoshimi Narita (My Senpai Is Annoying, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) is in charge of the series scripts. Hitomi Hasegawa (Twittering Birds Never Fly: The Clouds Gather animation director) is designing the characters. Naoya Homan is the dance choreographer, and Hajime Ohtani is the ballet technical director with ballet animation directors Tsuyoshi Kuwahara and Atsushi Ogasawara. MICHIRU is composing the music.

Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio.
