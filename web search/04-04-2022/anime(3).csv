My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.    Rating:                 My Dress-Up Darling is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.   <prevEpisode 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (341 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to My Dress-Up Darling Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B- Art : A-  + Quintessential Dragon Quest comfort food, fun and light − Being aimed at a younger audience means that it can be predictable            discuss this in the forum (11 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Riku Sanjō   Art: Kōji Inada   Full encyclopedia details aboutDragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan.

Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B- Art : A-  + Quintessential Dragon Quest comfort food, fun and light − Being aimed at a younger audience means that it can be predictable            discuss this in the forum (11 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Riku Sanjō   Art: Kōji Inada   Full encyclopedia details aboutDragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Review:         Synopsis:          Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions?

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan.

Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled.

Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

04-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-quest/the-adventure-of-dai/voiume-1/.183737,Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai GN 1 - Review - Anime News Network:SEA,"  Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect.

News Masamune-kun's Revenge Anime Gets 2nd Season   posted on 2022-04-01 23:43 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Trailer streamed for Masamune-kun no Revenge R     The official website for the television anime of Hazuki Takeoka and Tiv's Masamune-kun's Revenge (Masamune-kun no Revenge) manga announced on Saturday that the anime will get a second season titled Masamune-kun's Revenge R (Masamune-kun no Revenge R). The website streamed a promotional video that reveals the anime's new logo:       The website also released a comic strip on Saturday confirming the second season (pictured above). The website had previously released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3"" before even revealing a ""season 2"" (pictured below).     The television anime adaptation premiered in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga in North America, and it describes the story:   As an overweight child, Makabe Masamune was mercilessly teased and bullied by one particular girl, Adagaki Aki. Determined to one day exact his revenge upon her, Makabe begins a rigorous regimen of self-improvement and personal transformation.   Years later, Masamune re-emerges as a new man. Handsome, popular, with perfect grades and good at sports, Masamune-kun transfers to Aki's school, and is unrecognizable to her. Now, Masamune-kun is ready to confront the girl who bullied him so many years ago and humiliate her at last. But will revenge be as sweet as he thought?    The manga launched the series in Ichijinsha's Monthly Comic Rex magazine in 2012, and ended in June 2018. An original anime disc (OAD) that Ichijinsha bundled with the manga's 10th volume also tells an ""after story"" for the manga. The volume shipped in July 2018.    The manga got a special chapter in August 2020 about Masamune and Aki set after the original manga's final chapter.    Takeoka and Tiv launched the Masamune-kun no Revenge after school (Masamune-kun's Revenge after school) spinoff manga in Monthly Comic Rex September 2018, and ended it in January 2019. The manga tells similar ""after stories"" about the characters, including Masamune, Aki, and Yoshino, among others. Ichijinsha published the stories in one compiled book volume as the ""volume 11"" of the manga in April 2019, and Seven Seas Entertainment published the volume in June 2020.

News Masamune-kun's Revenge Anime Gets 2nd Season   posted on 2022-04-01 23:43 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Trailer streamed for Masamune-kun no Revenge R     The official website for the television anime of Hazuki Takeoka and Tiv's Masamune-kun's Revenge (Masamune-kun no Revenge) manga announced on Saturday that the anime will get a second season titled Masamune-kun's Revenge R (Masamune-kun no Revenge R). The website streamed a promotional video that reveals the anime's new logo:       The website also released a comic strip on Saturday confirming the second season (pictured above). The website had previously released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3"" before even revealing a ""season 2"" (pictured below).     The television anime adaptation premiered in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga in North America, and it describes the story:   As an overweight child, Makabe Masamune was mercilessly teased and bullied by one particular girl, Adagaki Aki. Determined to one day exact his revenge upon her, Makabe begins a rigorous regimen of self-improvement and personal transformation.   Years later, Masamune re-emerges as a new man. Handsome, popular, with perfect grades and good at sports, Masamune-kun transfers to Aki's school, and is unrecognizable to her. Now, Masamune-kun is ready to confront the girl who bullied him so many years ago and humiliate her at last. But will revenge be as sweet as he thought?    The manga launched the series in Ichijinsha's Monthly Comic Rex magazine in 2012, and ended in June 2018. An original anime disc (OAD) that Ichijinsha bundled with the manga's 10th volume also tells an ""after story"" for the manga. The volume shipped in July 2018.    The manga got a special chapter in August 2020 about Masamune and Aki set after the original manga's final chapter.    Takeoka and Tiv launched the Masamune-kun no Revenge after school (Masamune-kun's Revenge after school) spinoff manga in Monthly Comic Rex September 2018, and ended it in January 2019. The manga tells similar ""after stories"" about the characters, including Masamune, Aki, and Yoshino, among others. Ichijinsha published the stories in one compiled book volume as the ""volume 11"" of the manga in April 2019, and Seven Seas Entertainment published the volume in June 2020.

News Masamune-kun's Revenge Anime Gets 2nd Season   posted on 2022-04-01 23:43 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Trailer streamed for Masamune-kun no Revenge R     The official website for the television anime of Hazuki Takeoka and Tiv's Masamune-kun's Revenge (Masamune-kun no Revenge) manga announced on Saturday that the anime will get a second season titled Masamune-kun's Revenge R (Masamune-kun no Revenge R). The website streamed a promotional video that reveals the anime's new logo:       The website also released a comic strip on Saturday confirming the second season (pictured above). The website had previously released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3"" before even revealing a ""season 2"" (pictured below).     The television anime adaptation premiered in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga in North America, and it describes the story:   As an overweight child, Makabe Masamune was mercilessly teased and bullied by one particular girl, Adagaki Aki. Determined to one day exact his revenge upon her, Makabe begins a rigorous regimen of self-improvement and personal transformation.   Years later, Masamune re-emerges as a new man. Handsome, popular, with perfect grades and good at sports, Masamune-kun transfers to Aki's school, and is unrecognizable to her. Now, Masamune-kun is ready to confront the girl who bullied him so many years ago and humiliate her at last. But will revenge be as sweet as he thought?    The manga launched the series in Ichijinsha's Monthly Comic Rex magazine in 2012, and ended in June 2018. An original anime disc (OAD) that Ichijinsha bundled with the manga's 10th volume also tells an ""after story"" for the manga. The volume shipped in July 2018.    The manga got a special chapter in August 2020 about Masamune and Aki set after the original manga's final chapter.    Takeoka and Tiv launched the Masamune-kun no Revenge after school (Masamune-kun's Revenge after school) spinoff manga in Monthly Comic Rex September 2018, and ended it in January 2019. The manga tells similar ""after stories"" about the characters, including Masamune, Aki, and Yoshino, among others. Ichijinsha published the stories in one compiled book volume as the ""volume 11"" of the manga in April 2019, and Seven Seas Entertainment published the volume in June 2020.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    review          5 comments       The Lines that Define Me GN 1   Feb 22, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    One young man's foray into classic Japanese art might just be his path to healing. ― Although The Lines that Define Me is about suiboku-ga, or traditional Japanese ink painting, that's really only the vehicle through which the characters express themselves. Aoyama, the protagonist, is clearly not doing well from the moment we meet him setting up for an art exhibit – he's worryingly lightheaded as he ...                    review          10 comments       The Two Lions GN   Feb 21, 01:00 10 comments                 manga    One of Furuya's strengths as a storyteller is the ability to carefully and quietly capture real emotions of the sort that we typically hide inside ourselves; the insecurities that grow unchecked and cause people to misunderstand us. ― The Two Lions is Nagisa Furuya's third English language release – Renta brought over S & N and Kodansha released My Summer of You – and if there's one thing all three t...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

Successfully combining the two into a compelling narrative, therefore, isn't necessarily an easy feat.

August 5 is also the first day of Crunchyroll Expo.    The ""animal fantasy"" story of The Evolution Fruit: Before I Knew it, My Life Had It Made! centers on Seiichi Hiiragi. Though at the bottom of his school's social pecking order, he and his entire school are upended when everyone in the school is transported into another world. Seiichi finds himself alone and approached by a gorilla, who instead of attacking him, proposes to him. At the moment that Seiichi thinks that ""I guess a gorilla is fine too,"" they find the Fruit of Evolution, and when they eat it, their lives are suddenly changed once again.    Miku began serializing the story on the ""Shōsetsuka ni Narō"" (Let's Become Novelists) website in January 2014, where it is still ongoing. Futabasha's Monster Bunko light novel label began publishing the novel in print in September 2014, with illustrations by U35 (Lapis Re:LiGHTs, Aquatrope of White Sand character designs).    Hanashi Media, a new U.S-based manga and light novel publisher, licensed the light novel series in English and Spansh.    Sorano launched a manga adaptation of the novels on Futabasha's Web Comic Action manga website in September 2017.    The novels inspired a previous television anime series that premiered on October 4 and had 12 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (74 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          74 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  4, 01:29 74 comments                 anime    The thrilling conclusion of Magia Record is live!

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga?

(His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.)

General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was.

The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't).

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't).

04-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/ya-boy-kongming/.183524,Ya Boy Kongming! - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this.
