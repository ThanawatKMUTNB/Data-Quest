PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray.

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

News Bleach Manga Crosses 2.7 Million Copies in Print in U.S., My Hero Academia Manga Crosses 10 Million   posted on 2022-04-19 15:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Viz launches 20th Anniv. Edition of Bleach manga on August 2, 20-volume box set of My Hero Academia on October 18    Entertainment news magazine Variety reported on April 6 that Tite Kubo's Bleach manga has 2.7 million copies in print in the United States. Kōhei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia manga has over 10 million copies in print with its first volume having crossed 1.2 million copies in the United States. (Note: While Variety stated these numbers are ""sales"" numbers, Viz Media confirmed with ANN these numbers are ""copies in print."")   Viz Media will publish a 20th Anniversary Edition of the first volume of Bleach on August 2. The company will also launch a 20-volume box set of the My Hero Academia manga series on October 18. The release will feature a 48-page booklet with bonus illustrations and double-sided poster.    Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine published a new 73-page chapter of Bleach in August 2021.    Kubo launched Bleach in Weekly Shonen Jump in 2001, and ended it in August 2016. Viz Media published the manga in North America digitally in English as Shueisha published new chapters in Japan. Viz Media also published the manga in print.      The manga is inspiring a new anime adaptation that will premiere in October 2022. The anime will cover the ""Thousand Year Blood War"" arc, the final arc of the manga, that comprises volumes 55-74.   Shueisha announced on January 30 that Kōhei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia manga now has 65 million copies in circulation worldwide. The number includes copies in print and digital copies, but is not a sales statistic. The manga has a cumulative circulation of 45 million in Japan (including digital copies as well as copies in print sold and unsold).    Horikoshi launched the manga series in Weekly Shonen Jump in July 2014. Viz Media publishes the manga in English digitally and in print in North America. Shueisha's MANGA Plus service also publishes the manga in English digitally. The manga entered its ""final act"" in March 2021.    The fifth season of the anime adaptation of My Hero Academia premiered in Japan in March 2021, and aired for 25 episodes. The sixth season will premiere in fall 2022.

While Toei Animation are no angels themselves, this particular situation has nothing to do with them. This involves their parent company.   For more details:  https://tokusatsunetwork.com/2021/11/lawsuit-filed-against-toei-for-harassment-and-toxic-work-conditions/   Also while Toei Animation had their ransomware attack affecting everything that was airing (and the Dragon Ball Super movie's original premiere date), main Toei's shows were not affected since both Donbrothers & Kamen Rider Revice were still airing the entire time.

So you’d rather have people who aren’t a part of this to lose their jobs rather than have a restructuring at Toei by getting rid of the people causing the issues and bring in people who aren’t horrible to replace them      Back to top                  DRosencraft    Joined: 27 Apr 2010 		    Posts: 527       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 8:48 am            So a couple points, if I'm not mistaken. And please correct me if I'm wrong. First, this was to do with Toei, the parent company of Toei Animation. We don't know if the individuals or incidents in question are fully pervasive, as in uniformly across the organization or specific to one arm of Toei, etc.?    Second, this is a non-binding recommendation. Toei has no time-table they must adhere to, no checks by the court or administrative body to ensure the recommendations are put in place, no predetermined penalties if they fail to comply?   To me this is a major ball drop. It's tantamount to a slap on the wrist if Toei has no requirement to follow through. Perhaps the phrasing of it as ""recommendations"" implies it's less than what it really is, but at the moment I feel like Toei isn't sufficiently being held accountable. It's like mom and dad bust their kid for not doing their homework, tell their kid ""do your homework and no partying"" before going away on a week-long vacation with no supervision for the kid, and then act surprised when they find that the kid didn't do a bunch of homework and was partying all week.

While Toei Animation are no angels themselves, this particular situation has nothing to do with them. This involves their parent company.   For more details:  https://tokusatsunetwork.com/2021/11/lawsuit-filed-against-toei-for-harassment-and-toxic-work-conditions/   Also while Toei Animation had their ransomware attack affecting everything that was airing (and the Dragon Ball Super movie's original premiere date), main Toei's shows were not affected since both Donbrothers & Kamen Rider Revice were still airing the entire time.

So you’d rather have people who aren’t a part of this to lose their jobs rather than have a restructuring at Toei by getting rid of the people causing the issues and bring in people who aren’t horrible to replace them      Back to top                  DRosencraft    Joined: 27 Apr 2010 		    Posts: 527       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 8:48 am            So a couple points, if I'm not mistaken. And please correct me if I'm wrong. First, this was to do with Toei, the parent company of Toei Animation. We don't know if the individuals or incidents in question are fully pervasive, as in uniformly across the organization or specific to one arm of Toei, etc.?    Second, this is a non-binding recommendation. Toei has no time-table they must adhere to, no checks by the court or administrative body to ensure the recommendations are put in place, no predetermined penalties if they fail to comply?   To me this is a major ball drop. It's tantamount to a slap on the wrist if Toei has no requirement to follow through. Perhaps the phrasing of it as ""recommendations"" implies it's less than what it really is, but at the moment I feel like Toei isn't sufficiently being held accountable. It's like mom and dad bust their kid for not doing their homework, tell their kid ""do your homework and no partying"" before going away on a week-long vacation with no supervision for the kid, and then act surprised when they find that the kid didn't do a bunch of homework and was partying all week.

While Toei Animation are no angels themselves, this particular situation has nothing to do with them. This involves their parent company.   For more details:  https://tokusatsunetwork.com/2021/11/lawsuit-filed-against-toei-for-harassment-and-toxic-work-conditions/   Also while Toei Animation had their ransomware attack affecting everything that was airing (and the Dragon Ball Super movie's original premiere date), main Toei's shows were not affected since both Donbrothers & Kamen Rider Revice were still airing the entire time.

So you’d rather have people who aren’t a part of this to lose their jobs rather than have a restructuring at Toei by getting rid of the people causing the issues and bring in people who aren’t horrible to replace them      Back to top                  DRosencraft    Joined: 27 Apr 2010 		    Posts: 527       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 8:48 am            So a couple points, if I'm not mistaken. And please correct me if I'm wrong. First, this was to do with Toei, the parent company of Toei Animation. We don't know if the individuals or incidents in question are fully pervasive, as in uniformly across the organization or specific to one arm of Toei, etc.?    Second, this is a non-binding recommendation. Toei has no time-table they must adhere to, no checks by the court or administrative body to ensure the recommendations are put in place, no predetermined penalties if they fail to comply?   To me this is a major ball drop. It's tantamount to a slap on the wrist if Toei has no requirement to follow through. Perhaps the phrasing of it as ""recommendations"" implies it's less than what it really is, but at the moment I feel like Toei isn't sufficiently being held accountable. It's like mom and dad bust their kid for not doing their homework, tell their kid ""do your homework and no partying"" before going away on a week-long vacation with no supervision for the kid, and then act surprised when they find that the kid didn't do a bunch of homework and was partying all week.

While Toei Animation are no angels themselves, this particular situation has nothing to do with them. This involves their parent company.   For more details:  https://tokusatsunetwork.com/2021/11/lawsuit-filed-against-toei-for-harassment-and-toxic-work-conditions/   Also while Toei Animation had their ransomware attack affecting everything that was airing (and the Dragon Ball Super movie's original premiere date), main Toei's shows were not affected since both Donbrothers & Kamen Rider Revice were still airing the entire time.

So you’d rather have people who aren’t a part of this to lose their jobs rather than have a restructuring at Toei by getting rid of the people causing the issues and bring in people who aren’t horrible to replace them      Back to top                  DRosencraft    Joined: 27 Apr 2010 		    Posts: 527       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 8:48 am            So a couple points, if I'm not mistaken. And please correct me if I'm wrong. First, this was to do with Toei, the parent company of Toei Animation. We don't know if the individuals or incidents in question are fully pervasive, as in uniformly across the organization or specific to one arm of Toei, etc.?    Second, this is a non-binding recommendation. Toei has no time-table they must adhere to, no checks by the court or administrative body to ensure the recommendations are put in place, no predetermined penalties if they fail to comply?   To me this is a major ball drop. It's tantamount to a slap on the wrist if Toei has no requirement to follow through. Perhaps the phrasing of it as ""recommendations"" implies it's less than what it really is, but at the moment I feel like Toei isn't sufficiently being held accountable. It's like mom and dad bust their kid for not doing their homework, tell their kid ""do your homework and no partying"" before going away on a week-long vacation with no supervision for the kid, and then act surprised when they find that the kid didn't do a bunch of homework and was partying all week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak.

Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill.

Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy.

I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.

No disrespect to Chris Judge, Steve Blum, or Chris Sabat as actors but uh... these people never really work together, esp in anime?? Even with remote recording and everything that featured a ton of bi-coastal casting, so I can't help but be like ""this is a bit strange.""

Chris Judge plays Kratos in the recent God of War games, Steve Blum's involvement in anime these days is limited to union stuff, if at all, and Christ Sabat is a name that gets noticed.  I'm assuming this probably had the budget to go and get particular actors.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

No disrespect to Chris Judge, Steve Blum, or Chris Sabat as actors but uh... these people never really work together, esp in anime?? Even with remote recording and everything that featured a ton of bi-coastal casting, so I can't help but be like ""this is a bit strange."" It almost feels like the production company said ""we want these specific actors for the dub because they are well-known in the industry.""

Chris Judge plays Kratos in the recent God of War games, Steve Blum's involvement in anime these days is limited to union stuff, if at all, and Christ Sabat is a name that gets noticed.  I'm assuming this probably had the budget to go and get particular actors.

I assume someone here at ANN will review it sometime.

Waka waka   But seriously, I feel like we all need to be more uncomfortable regarding a production made by the propaganda arm of MBS. This isn't just some random Saudi production company, the article provides a quote the explicitly tells us what this company is...anyway, HARD pass.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Saudi Arabia didn't have sanctions on their country that essentially makes their currency  worthless.  Businesses pulling out of Russia aren't doing it for moral reasons even if they might frame it that way.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Saudi Arabia didn't have sanctions on their country that essentially makes their currency  worthless.  Businesses pulling out of Russia aren't doing it for moral reasons even if they might frame it that way.

However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).

SEGA has a lot of IPs which they never brought back, I'd like to see a remake of the first four Phantasy Star games.  Now, I've heard that these reboots are part of a ""Super Game"" project that SEGA of Japan has mentioned a couple of years ago, but it seems like they're are aiming for the Fortnite crowd and that they're going to be free-to-play with microtransactions. Not to mention there were some rumors that SEGA of Japan is interested in the NFT business. That doesn't sound so good      Back to top                  MarshalBanana    Joined: 31 Aug 2014 		    Posts: 4548       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 2:18 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Never played Jet Set Radio but I did play Crazy Taxi in the arcades.

Hold a launch event in a refurbished Tower Records, for example. Get the Offspring to perform, of course.

III & IV remakes were also planned, but cancelled due to poor sales of the first two, I believe.

SEGA has a lot of IPs which they never brought back, I'd like to see a remake of the first four Phantasy Star games.  Now, I've heard that these reboots are part of a ""Super Game"" project that SEGA of Japan has mentioned a couple of years ago, but it seems like they're are aiming for the Fortnite crowd and that they're going to be free-to-play with microtransactions. Not to mention there were some rumors that SEGA of Japan is interested in the NFT business. That doesn't sound so good      Back to top                  MarshalBanana    Joined: 31 Aug 2014 		    Posts: 4548       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 2:18 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Never played Jet Set Radio but I did play Crazy Taxi in the arcades.

Hold a launch event in a refurbished Tower Records, for example. Get the Offspring to perform, of course.

III & IV remakes were also planned, but cancelled due to poor sales of the first two, I believe.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Episodes 1-3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6                    How would you rate episode 2 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Episodes 1-3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6                    How would you rate episode 2 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Episodes 1-3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?

Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles.

The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society.

While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie.

News Crunchyroll Debuts Estab-Life: Great Escape Anime's English Dub on Wednesday   posted on 2022-04-20 09:55 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Dub stars Julie Shields, Alexis Tipton, Sarah Wiedenheft, Cris George, Anthony Bowling, more    Crunchyroll announced on Tuesday that its English dub for the Estab-Life: Great Escape original anime project by Goro Taniguchi will debut with the first episode on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. EDT. The dub's cast, under ADR Director Jeremy Inman, ADR engineer Jeremy Woods, ADR script writer Jarrod Greene, and ADR mix engineer William Dewell, includes:     Julie Shields as Equa   Alexis Tipton as Feles   Sarah Wiedenheft as Martes   Cris George as Ulula   Anthony Bowling as Alga   Molly Searcy   Lucía Lobosvilla   Dusty Feeney   Kelsey Maher   Rachel Thompson   Kyle Phillips   Jeff Johnson   Rex Underwood   Jim Foronda   Larry Brantley    The first four episodes of the show began streaming on the FOD service in Japan on March 1. The show then premiered on television on April 6 on the +Ultra anime programming block on Fuji TV and its affiliates, and Crunchyroll streams the anime outside Asia.    The anime stars:     Tomomi Mineuchi as Equa, the Nigashiya leader   Rie Takahashi as Feles, the superbly athletic, quick-firing ""gun wizard""  Maria Naganawa as Martes, a slime-human  Sho Hayami as Alga, an old fogey of an AI robot  Shinichiro Miki as Ulula, a wolfman who says nothing but ""wan"" (woof)   The project will have a television anime, smartphone game, and anime film, which have the themes of ""escape,"" ""records,"" and ""variant,"" respectively. (The English subtitle for Estab Life is ""Establishment in Life."")    The story is set in the distant future when the world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence.    Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Taniguchi is credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the Estab-Life: Great Escape television anime, and SSF is credited with the original story. Hiroyuki Hashimoto (Is the order a rabbit?, Slow Start) is directing the anime at Polygon Pictures, and Shoji Gatoh (Full Metal Panic!, Hyou-ka, Cop Craft) is supervising and writing the scripts.    Yūsuke Kozaki (No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, Fire Emblem Awakening, Bubuki Buranki) drafted the original character designs, and INEI's Kenichiro Tomiyasu (Harlock: Space Pirate, Human Lost, Night Head 2041, Resident Evil: Damnation) drafted the concept art. Yoshiaki Fujisawa (No Game, No Life Zero, A Place Further Than the Universe, Revue Starlight) is composing the music. Slow Curve developed and produced the project.    Five-member band GOOD ON THE REEL perform the ending theme song ""0.""    Square Enix is developing the Estab-Life: Unity Memories smartphone game. Taniguchi is also credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the game, and SSF likewise is credited with the original story.    Taniguchi is also personally directing and writing Eiga Estab-Life: Revengers' Road (Estab-Life the Movie: Revengers' Road), in addition to conceiving the original concept. SSF is again credited with the original story, and Polygon Pictures is producing the animation.

The manga is still ongoing so I'm kind of curious how they'll conclude it. Obviously the final boss is anime Zetton, but will Leo and Astra show up?

But in relation to this teaser, it definitely feels like production plans for this anime got cut / cancelled. As a result, we are gonna get an anime original ending. But at least NetFlix is giving the series a proper ending rather than just getting rid of it unceremoniously like they do many other shows.   Doubt we will see the Leo Brothers. Their whole storyline involves being hired to assassinate Adad, and I simply don't see it happening since we seem to be rushing towards a finale.

This is one of the major differences: in the manga this was revealed at the end of a double digit volume, in the anime they drop this bombshell in the 1st episode.

The manga is still ongoing so I'm kind of curious how they'll conclude it. Obviously the final boss is anime Zetton, but will Leo and Astra show up?

But in relation to this teaser, it definitely feels like production plans for this anime got cut / cancelled. As a result, we are gonna get an anime original ending. But at least NetFlix is giving the series a proper ending rather than just getting rid of it unceremoniously like they do many other shows.   Doubt we will see the Leo Brothers. Their whole storyline involves being hired to assassinate Adad, and I simply don't see it happening since we seem to be rushing towards a finale.

The manga is still ongoing so I'm kind of curious how they'll conclude it. Obviously the final boss is anime Zetton, but will Leo and Astra show up?

But in relation to this teaser, it definitely feels like production plans for this anime got cut / cancelled. As a result, we are gonna get an anime original ending. But at least NetFlix is giving the series a proper ending rather than just getting rid of it unceremoniously like they do many other shows.   Doubt we will see the Leo Brothers. Their whole storyline involves being hired to assassinate Adad, and I simply don't see it happening since we seem to be rushing towards a finale.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.        Hello, Melancholic! GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.         I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost. We asked Sato about some of the challenges of playing a dead boy, his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.        The Orbital Children From the creator of Den-noh Coil comes a story about the interconnectivity of humans, artificial intelligence, and our species own mortality.  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          11 comments       Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 21, 03:30 11 comments                 anime    This isn't your dad's golf.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.        Hello, Melancholic! GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.         I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost. We asked Sato about some of the challenges of playing a dead boy, his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.        The Orbital Children From the creator of Den-noh Coil comes a story about the interconnectivity of humans, artificial intelligence, and our species own mortality.  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          11 comments       Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 21, 03:30 11 comments                 anime    This isn't your dad's golf.

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.        Hello, Melancholic! GN 1 This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.         I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost. We asked Sato about some of the challenges of playing a dead boy, his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.        The Orbital Children From the creator of Den-noh Coil comes a story about the interconnectivity of humans, artificial intelligence, and our species own mortality.  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          11 comments       Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 21, 03:30 11 comments                 anime    This isn't your dad's golf.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.

Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          1 comment       New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   Apr 21, 18:25 1 comment                 anime    Hana, other new characters teased ― The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.

I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much.

Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together.

Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.

News Semelparous Manga Moves to Irregular Serialization Due to Author's Health   posted on 2022-04-19 03:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga has been on break as Jun Ogino undergoes medical treatment    This year's June issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Yuri Hime magazine revealed on Monday that Jun Ogino's Semelparous will move to an irregular serialization due to the author's health. Ogino is currently undergoing medical treatment for his illness. The manga has been on a break since the magazine's March issue. The magazine will provide more information in its next issue on when it expects to publish the manga's next chapter.    Seven Seas licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    Ever since they were young girls, best friends Yorino and Haruka have been training to become Bastioners–soldiers who battle in a walled area that protects humanity from the kaiju trying to break through. But when Haruka is killed during a routine exercise, Yorino must fight even harder to make sure she never loses someone close to her again.   Ogino launched the manga in Comic Yuri Hime in November 2019, adapting it from an earlier one-shot manga titled ""Tagai no Guardian"" (Each Other's Guardian), which Ogino published in Comic Yuri Hime in September 2016. Ichijinsha published the manga's third compiled book volume in August 2021.

News Semelparous Manga Moves to Irregular Serialization Due to Author's Health   posted on 2022-04-19 03:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga has been on break as Jun Ogino undergoes medical treatment    This year's June issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Yuri Hime magazine revealed on Monday that Jun Ogino's Semelparous will move to an irregular serialization due to the author's health. Ogino is currently undergoing medical treatment for his illness. The manga has been on a break since the magazine's March issue. The magazine will provide more information in its next issue on when it expects to publish the manga's next chapter.    Seven Seas licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    Ever since they were young girls, best friends Yorino and Haruka have been training to become Bastioners–soldiers who battle in a walled area that protects humanity from the kaiju trying to break through. But when Haruka is killed during a routine exercise, Yorino must fight even harder to make sure she never loses someone close to her again.   Ogino launched the manga in Comic Yuri Hime in November 2019, adapting it from an earlier one-shot manga titled ""Tagai no Guardian"" (Each Other's Guardian), which Ogino published in Comic Yuri Hime in September 2016. Ichijinsha published the manga's third compiled book volume in August 2021.

News Semelparous Manga Moves to Irregular Serialization Due to Author's Health   posted on 2022-04-19 03:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga has been on break as Jun Ogino undergoes medical treatment    This year's June issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Yuri Hime magazine revealed on Monday that Jun Ogino's Semelparous will move to an irregular serialization due to the author's health. Ogino is currently undergoing medical treatment for his illness. The manga has been on a break since the magazine's March issue. The magazine will provide more information in its next issue on when it expects to publish the manga's next chapter.    Seven Seas licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    Ever since they were young girls, best friends Yorino and Haruka have been training to become Bastioners–soldiers who battle in a walled area that protects humanity from the kaiju trying to break through. But when Haruka is killed during a routine exercise, Yorino must fight even harder to make sure she never loses someone close to her again.   Ogino launched the manga in Comic Yuri Hime in November 2019, adapting it from an earlier one-shot manga titled ""Tagai no Guardian"" (Each Other's Guardian), which Ogino published in Comic Yuri Hime in September 2016. Ichijinsha published the manga's third compiled book volume in August 2021.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.
