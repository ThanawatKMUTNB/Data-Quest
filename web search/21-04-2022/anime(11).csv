Hastings said, ""Those that have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription. But as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice. And allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising-tolerant, get what they want, makes a lot of sense.""    Hastings' statement follows Netflix's Tuesday announcement of a decrease of about 200,000 subscribers from January to March — far below the company's earlier projection of a gain of 2.5 million subscribers. This is the service's first drop in subscriptions in a decade.    Netflix attributed the drop to its already high household penetration, account password sharing, and increasing competition. It also cited broader economic factors such as inflation and the war in Ukraine. (Netflix's suspension in Russia alone resulted in a loss of 700,000 subscriptions.) The drop in subscriptions led to Netflix's stock price dropping about 25%.    Netflix projects a further decrease of around 2 million subscribers in the April-June quarter. The addition of a low-cost ad-supported subscription would be one attempt by the company to stem the subscriber bleed.    The streaming service only recently implemented a price increase in subscription plans in the United States and Canada earlier this year.    Meanwhile, anime streaming service Crunchyroll recently removed its long-running free ad-supported simulcast viewing option in the beginning of the spring anime season in April, with only a few exceptions. (Some spring season titles are available for free ad-supported viewing for their first three episodes a week after they premiere, and older titles are still available for free with ads.) The service previously allowed free ad-supported streaming for simulcast titles one week after an episode premiered.    Disney+, another streaming service that is adding more anime titles, plans to roll out an ad-supported subscription tier in the United States and Canada in late 2022, and then roll it out overseas next year.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit.

The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

21-04-2022,anime,9,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-20/why-girls-und-panzer-works-so-well/.183891,Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well   by Bhromor Rahman, Apr 20th 2022          CGDCT, or “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things,” is a genre in anime that usually revolves around a high school setting where cute girls in school uniforms talk about love, discuss fashion, go shopping, share a hobby, and do other things without a single guy in sight. One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

One of the great advantages of CGDCT is that it's a very versatile genre that can easily mesh with other genres. By its very nature, it pairs really well with slice-of-life anime (examples include Gabriel DropOut and Lucky Star), but it can also work with comedy (Asobi Asobase) and even horror (School-Live!).    But if there was a genre that CGDCT should absolutely not be compatible with in theory, it would be military themes. After all, is there anything more traditionally symbolic of masculinity and virility than warfare, tanks, guns, explosions, and military tactics? It's just not supposed to work. Yet, not only does Girls und Panzer manage to pull that combination off, but it completely subverts the stereotype.    Girls und Panzer, or GuP for short, follows Miho Nishizumi, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, as she tries to lead her haphazard Sensha-Do team to victory. Sensha-Do, or ""Tankery"" in English, is a women's discipline in the GuP universe that pits teams against each other in battles with tanks that were designed before August 15th, 1945, the date of the Japanese surrender.   An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.

The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.

An Extended Cast Of Cute Girls   The main protagonist, Miho, happens to descend from a long line of Sensha-Do practitioners, and has inherited the Nishizumi-style (or the equivalent of German mid- to late-war Panzerkeil tank tactics). Unfortunately for Miho, as vice-commander of Kuromorimine High School, home of the Nishizumi-style, she committed the terrible transgression in her family's eyes of saving a teammate from possibly drowning instead of fighting her opponent, which cost her team their tenth consecutive win in the high school tournament. Cast out in the eyes of her mother, Miho decides to transfer to a school without a Sensha-Do team, Oarai Girls' Academy. Regrettably for her, she is once again pulled back into the sport when the school's student council decides to score a victory in the Sensha-Do tournament as a way to save their school from closing.     In addition to being the commander of the entire Oarai team, Miho is the tank commander of a Panzer IV Ausf.D, which is crewed by the anime's principal supporting characters: flower arranger Hana is the gunner, tank enthusiast (and everyone's floofy raison d'être) Yukari the loader, sleepy genius Mako the driver, and love-obsessed chatterbox Saori the radio operator. Between the Oarai team and its opponents, GuP has a colorful cast of characters that each have a distinct personality and contribute to the show in a significant way.     Of course, visual appeal is one of the main reasons why the GuP turned out so successful. Looking at the way the girls behave, what they wear, and the way they look, there is an obvious intent to maximize the cast's girliness in every way. However, the genius of Girls und Panzer is in how the show manages to mesh the girliness with militarism. The best example is in the uniforms the girls wear during Sensha-Do matches. The top of the uniform is designed similar to the military uniform that a soldier of a given country would wear during World War II, but the bottom is short skirt. Somehow, it just works.     This combination is well-executed in the girls' characterization as well. For instance, Miho's family legacy and her ensuing conflict with the rest of her family sticks out in the usually conflict-avoidant CGDCT genre, but since the source of friction originated from an act of kindness – even heroism – on her part, it makes Miho easy to root for as the underdog. In fact, in every match, Oarai is always presented as the overwhelming underdog only to come out on top at the end thanks to Miho's prowess as a commander. A similarly complementary dynamic exists in the characterization of Miho's companions as well, such as Saori's extraversion and talkativeness turning her into an excellent tank radio operator. Once again, all the pieces just fall into place.   Masterclass In Coherent Worldbuilding   The strength of Girls und Panzer does not lie in its linear and repetitive plot. Oarai always faces a team presented as an overwhelming threat and Miho always has to find creative ways to win. To force the encounter, the show will employ straightforward plot devices such as the government shutting down the school unless Oarai wins in Sensha-Do. However, the simple plot arguably doesn't take anything away from the show. A lot of anime that start out with an ambitious plot tend to get lost in the weeds with side stories, flashbacks spanning several episodes, or dull exposition that only leave more plot holes, ruining the flow of the show (DARLING in the FRANXX is a good example of trying to do too much). Girls und Panzer's barebones premise allows the show to focus on its strengths, which are worldbuilding, tank battles, historical references, and cute girls.     That said, there is more to worldbuilding than simply making the most imaginative setting possible or adding a few gimmicks here and there. Even the most outlandish fictional world needs a semblance of coherence to its internal logic, which largely depends on how the characters react to the world in which they inhabit. And in this regard, Girls und Panzer excels: its first episode does an amazing job at presenting the anime as a cookie-cutter CGDCT series in a high school before slowly lulling its audience into accepting Sensha-Do – and all the madness that is to come later – as a natural extension of girls' normal high school life.     Hence, even the absence of male players in an activity so rooted in masculinity becomes a trivial detail in GuP when the girls wholeheartedly believe that Sensha-Do is a women's sport that helps women become more feminine, and admit that they have a hard time associating men with tanks. The same can be said about other oddities like school campuses being built on giant school ships that look like aircraft carriers, the student council essentially running said schools as they see fit, or high school students having the technical expertise to operate and maintain automobiles, let alone World War II era tanks. Girls und Panzer simply treats these absurdities as the most mundane of affairs, and brings its audience along for the ride.   Girls und Panzer Is Actually A Sports Anime   By now, it's clear that Girls und Panzer is a successful blend of the military and CGDCT genres. However, Girls und Panzer uses the powers of gap moe to push itself even further into the sports genre as well. The anime goes to great lengths to detach Sensha-Do from warfare and violence, structuring it more as a sport with official rules and friendly competition. This also allows the show to incorporate many tropes typically found in other sports anime.    First, there is a clear progression between Oarai's amateurish Sensha-Do team at the start of the anime to the well-oiled machine it becomes later. Then, there is the main protagonist, Miho, being a uniquely talented individual in leading the school to victory with her brilliant strategies. In every arc, there is an overwhelmingly powerful team presented as an almost insurmountable threat, but there are no hard feelings once the battle is over, as both Oarai and its rivals strive to uphold the sportsmanship of Sensha-Do together. Between matches, the Oarai team will search for new tanks or improve its existing ones, as well as hold practice sessions.     Girls und Panzer even contains the usual exaggerated stakes that sports anime are known for. For example, Oarai's entire existence hinges on its success in a high school sports tournament. The exaggeration is also extended to character arcs. Miho isn't the only one who is cast out from her family; Hana's mother literally disowns her for choosing Sensha-Do over dedicating herself fully to arranging flowers. In fact, Miho being condemned for saving a life instead of winning the match is reminiscent of episode 64 of Captain Tsubasa where Jun's ailing heart finally gives in, and the only one to have stayed with him, Kojiro, was later chastised by his coach for not continuing to play.   A Treasure Trove Of Historical References   Above all, what Girls und Panzer excels at the most is in its historical references. They are often presented as humoristic, lighthearted stereotypes of various countries that perfectly fit the simple narrative and military theme of the anime. All the schools in Girls und Panzer are entirely situated in Japan, but each of them is themed after a country, which is reflected in their philosophy, lifestyle, and of course, Sensha-Do.     For example, the Russian school is based on the Soviet Union and named Pravda (“Truth” in Russian), which was the official slogan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The school also has no elected student council, and is instead run by their Sensha-Do commander, Katyusha, who is essentially blond loli Stalin. During their match against Oarai, the Pravda team sang “Katyusha”, which is a Soviet folk song commonly sung by Red Army soldiers. Similarly, Pravda's tank tactics are based on Red Army doctrine, such as double envelopments and fighting in winter conditions.     Girls und Panzer finds ingenious ways to poke fun at every country no matter how little screen time they might get. The Australian team, Koala Forest Academy, only appears for around 30 seconds in the second part of Das Finale, but in that time, we see that the team's commander is a literal koala, and their vice-commander's name is Wallaby. The Japanese team, Chihatan Academy, demonstrates that the show's writing isn't above self-derision, as the team constantly obsesses over charging into battle no matter how tactically unsound it might be. The British St.Gloriana Girls' College constantly drinks tea, the American Saunders University High School is the wealthiest, and the French BC Freedom Academy had an actual revolution in the Taiyaki War! OVA, and so on.     The historical references don't stop there. Almost the entire original soundtrack of Girls und Panzer is military music. This is especially true for each school's background theme, such as “Panzerlied” playing whenever the German Kuromorimine Girls' Academy appears, or “Funiculi, funicula"" for the Italian Anzio High School. Even character names in the anime are historical references. For example, Nishizumi is a reference to The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, a 1940 Japanese humanist film, and Erika refers to the popular German military song of the same name. Oarai's Hippo Team, which operates a StuG III, is made up of history buffs who each have nicknames based on a major historical figure, and are knowledgeable about their respective eras, which leads them to make many obscure historical references in their remarks that are really funny if you understand them.     Of course, the tanks and tactics that each school uses are also based on their respective countries, but the tank battles themselves are quite entertaining even if you're not an expert on tank warfare. However, for those who are in the know, the depth of historical detail in Girls und Panzer is astonishing, and a delight for historians. For example, Yannick Mudinda, a top warfare expert from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal, came to appreciate the show's attention to detail.     “It's that tactical aspect of Girls und Panzer that makes it interesting and fun to watch,” Mudinda told me. “Each team has its own style that more or less matches the country it's supposed to represent.” He added that his favorite moment was in Der Film, ""when the Finnish [Jatkosota High School] was still able to drive the BT-42 on its wheels after its tracks were removed, which was a real feature the tank had.” While there are many moments that remind viewers that Girls und Panzer is indeed an anime – such as tank drifting, impossible jumps, and fanservice beach OVAs – the historical references sprinkled throughout keeps it feeling fresh even during repeated viewings..     Overall, it is the characters and the worldbuilding that ensure a fluid transition between the slice of life scenes and the tank battles of Girls und Panzer. That's why the show's fusion confusion works so well. Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere.

Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships.

Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music.

Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.

News iCONTACT Soccer Manga's 1st Part Ends   posted on 2022-04-21 02:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          The Knight in the Area manga duo launched new manga in August 2021    This year's 21st issue of Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine published the ending of the first part of Hiroaki Igano and Kaya Tsukiyama's iCONTACT soccer manga on Wednesday. The manga's fourth compiled book volume will ship on June 17, and will be the final volume for the first part.    The manga centers on Shishi Sakurazaka, a soccer player in his third year of middle school. He has speed that puts dedicated track runners to shame, but has no talent for shooting a goal, which has led to him being an eternal benchwarmer. But one day, while playing an online soccer game, he meets a genius gamer.    Igano and Tsukiyama launched the manga in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in August 2021. Kodansha published the manga's third volume on March 17.    Igano and Tsukiyama most notable previously collaborated on The Knight in the Area, another soccer manga. That manga launched in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in 2006, and ended in 2017. Kodansha published the manga's 57th and final compiled book volume in 2017. The spinoff manga Area no Kishi Bangai-hen: Enokō Early Days about the high school days of Coach Iwaki debuted in 2007, and Kodansha's Manga Box app released the series. The original manga also inspired a four-panel gag comedy manga. A television anime adaptation premiered in 2012, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.    Tsukiyama and Igano also collaborated on the Kami-sama no Koibito manga, which launched in March 2019, and ended in February 2020.    Igano's other pseudonyms include Yuya Aoki (GetBackers), Tadashi Agi (The Drops of God), Ryō Ryūmon (Bloody Monday), Seimaru Amagi (Kindaichi Case Files original idea), and Yuma Ando (Psychometrer, Psychometrer Eiji, Sherlock Bones).

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

News Crunchyroll's CEO Colin Decker Leaves Company; Rahul Purini Becomes New President   posted on 2022-04-20 02:09 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Purini served as COO for Crunchyroll/Funimation     Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed on Tuesday that Crunchyroll's chief executive officer Colin Decker is leaving the company. Crunchyroll's chief operating officer and Funimation's longtime COO Rahul Purini will become the company's new president. Decker will remain with the company for a few weeks during the transition.    As COO, Purini spearheaded Crunchyroll's strategic day-to-day operations, including e-Commerce, production studios, content programming, business intelligence, analytics, and other functions. Purini joined Funimation in 2015 and has led the company's growth in global expansion and subscription base. He previously served as vice president of solution delivery at global digital agency Razorfish. He was also head of technology and operations for digital agency MEplusYOU (formerly imc2). Purini has earned industry awards from Forrestor and Forbes for his team's work at Pizza Hut, Procter & Gamble, and GlaxoSmithKline.    Purini stated, ""It is an honor and a privilege for me to take on this new role, and to drive the next chapter of Crunchyroll forward. Having spent the last seven years involved in nearly every facet of the business, and seeing how far we've come – the opportunity ahead is bright, and I look forward to what we will do together next. There are so many things that excite me about this new role, but the one part that stands out is our clear opportunity: to accelerate the growth, size, and love of anime around the world by putting fans and community first and by helping everyone belong.""    Decker became Funimation's new general manager in May 2019. He worked to collaborate with the other anime businesses within Sony, including Sony Music Entertainment's Aniplex subsidiary and Sony Pictures Entertainment's Animax anime channel. He served as CEO of Crunchyroll when Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of the company.    Decker previously worked in Crunchyroll as chief operating officer and then in Within Unlimited as chief operating officer, before joining Funimation. Before Crunchyroll, Decker was the general manager of Discovery Digital Networks.    Colin Decker said to the company, ""Working alongside you has been an honor, and a privilege. Because of your dedication, resilience, and belief, we have realized what seemed impossible just a few years ago.""    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.    Funimation's home video releases are also becoming listed under Crunchyroll.    Crunchyroll and Funimation first announced the acquisition in December 2020 with a purchase price of US$1.175 billion. The technology website The Information reported in August 2020 that AT&T offered Crunchyroll to Sony for US$1.5 billion and that Sony reportedly ""balked at"" the price, which effectively valued the streaming service at US$500 per subscriber. Entertainment news source Variety reported that AT&T was shopping the company to multiple potential buyers aside from Sony Pictures Entertainment at that time. Nikkei Asia later reported that October that Sony was in final negotiations for the Crunchyroll acquisition. At that time, the newspaper reported that Sony ""could end up spending more than 100 billion yen ($957 million).""    Update: Purini's new position has been updated.

News Crunchyroll's CEO Colin Decker Leaves Company; Rahul Purini Becomes New President   posted on 2022-04-20 02:09 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Purini served as COO for Crunchyroll/Funimation     Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed on Tuesday that Crunchyroll's chief executive officer Colin Decker is leaving the company. Crunchyroll's chief operating officer and Funimation's longtime COO Rahul Purini will become the company's new president. Decker will remain with the company for a few weeks during the transition.    As COO, Purini spearheaded Crunchyroll's strategic day-to-day operations, including e-Commerce, production studios, content programming, business intelligence, analytics, and other functions. Purini joined Funimation in 2015 and has led the company's growth in global expansion and subscription base. He previously served as vice president of solution delivery at global digital agency Razorfish. He was also head of technology and operations for digital agency MEplusYOU (formerly imc2). Purini has earned industry awards from Forrestor and Forbes for his team's work at Pizza Hut, Procter & Gamble, and GlaxoSmithKline.    Purini stated, ""It is an honor and a privilege for me to take on this new role, and to drive the next chapter of Crunchyroll forward. Having spent the last seven years involved in nearly every facet of the business, and seeing how far we've come – the opportunity ahead is bright, and I look forward to what we will do together next. There are so many things that excite me about this new role, but the one part that stands out is our clear opportunity: to accelerate the growth, size, and love of anime around the world by putting fans and community first and by helping everyone belong.""    Decker became Funimation's new general manager in May 2019. He worked to collaborate with the other anime businesses within Sony, including Sony Music Entertainment's Aniplex subsidiary and Sony Pictures Entertainment's Animax anime channel. He served as CEO of Crunchyroll when Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of the company.    Decker previously worked in Crunchyroll as chief operating officer and then in Within Unlimited as chief operating officer, before joining Funimation. Before Crunchyroll, Decker was the general manager of Discovery Digital Networks.    Colin Decker said to the company, ""Working alongside you has been an honor, and a privilege. Because of your dedication, resilience, and belief, we have realized what seemed impossible just a few years ago.""    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.    Funimation's home video releases are also becoming listed under Crunchyroll.    Crunchyroll and Funimation first announced the acquisition in December 2020 with a purchase price of US$1.175 billion. The technology website The Information reported in August 2020 that AT&T offered Crunchyroll to Sony for US$1.5 billion and that Sony reportedly ""balked at"" the price, which effectively valued the streaming service at US$500 per subscriber. Entertainment news source Variety reported that AT&T was shopping the company to multiple potential buyers aside from Sony Pictures Entertainment at that time. Nikkei Asia later reported that October that Sony was in final negotiations for the Crunchyroll acquisition. At that time, the newspaper reported that Sony ""could end up spending more than 100 billion yen ($957 million).""    Update: Purini's new position has been updated.
