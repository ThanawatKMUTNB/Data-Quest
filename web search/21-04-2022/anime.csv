It's been a few days since we've said hello to 2022, but we don't want to forget the great anime news we heard in 2021 just yet! That's why we put together a selection of TOM News articles that our readers loved. 2021 was a busy year, so perhaps some will be new to you - on the other hand, if you've already seen all of them, thank you for being such a great reader!First, we have five articles on huge announcements for manga, anime, and more. After that, you'll find five of our original articles, with some appearances from our very own TOM Senpais. Simply click on each title or thumbnail to check them out! TOM News ☆ Bleach One-Shot Manga Debuts With Epic Cliffhanger!20 years after  Bleach burst onto the scene, it blew our minds again with a one-shot titled New Breathes From Hell! We won't spoil the ending for you if you haven't read it, but it's well worth a look. We're still pondering over the huge questions it poses for the future of Ichigo and his friends... ☆ The Saga of Tanya the Evil Season 2 Confirmed!We may not have any more details on Season 2 yet, but TOM News readers were clearly as pumped as we were to hear that Tanya will be back! Hopefully, we'll be hearing more soon. ☆ Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku Gets TV Anime Adaptation!Yuji Kaku's manga ended this January after a three-year run, but at least we won't be saying goodbye completely! Not to mention, the series will be animated by MAPPA, the studio behind hit series like  Jujutsu Kaisen and  Dorohedoro, not to mention the final season of  Attack on Titan. Have you seen the trailer yet? ☆ Hatsune Miku to Get ""Mikuverse"" With Animated Series and More!Just when we thought Miku couldn't get any bigger, she surprised us yet again with an upcoming ""Mikuverse!"" Be sure to check out what's to come if you haven't already. ☆ Spirited Away Stage Adaptation Confirms Main Cast!Stage plays are a huge industry in Japan, but we never expected this beloved Ghibli film would be the next one! It'll premiere early next year, so we're pumped to find out what  Spirited Away will look like in a new medium. TOM Original Articles ☆ WonHobby 33 Photo ReportWe definitely haven't been taking anime and figure-related events for granted this year, so we were thrilled to give you a peek at Good Smile Company and Max Factory's WonHobby 33. Looking back now, you might recognize a few prototypes that have since been released as gorgeous new figures... ☆ I Saw Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Train 16 Times - Here Are 9 Reasons You Have to See It!Well, the title says it all! This article was created with the love and devotion of our resident KNY expert, so even if you aren't a fan of the series, this might just convince you. ☆ Hatsune Miku Chronicle Event ReportMiku is such a huge presence that it's easy to forget she officially came into the world only 14 years ago. If you want to look back with us, check out the event, which chronicles her impressive background! ☆ Beginner's Guide to Jujutsu Kaisen!Okay, you can be honest - raise your hand if you haven't read/watched  Jujutsu Kaisen yet. Maybe you've been occupied with other things or just don't feel like starting a new series, but if you have a spare moment, feel free to take our crash course! ☆ How to Photograph Figures: Teach Me, TOM Senpai!One of our TOM Senpais, who happens to be a wizard at photography, created this awesome guide in the lead-up to our 3rd Figure Photo Contest, but it definitely applies all year round!Thanks for making it to the end!

After that, you'll find five of our original articles, with some appearances from our very own TOM Senpais. Simply click on each title or thumbnail to check them out! TOM News ☆ Bleach One-Shot Manga Debuts With Epic Cliffhanger!20 years after  Bleach burst onto the scene, it blew our minds again with a one-shot titled New Breathes From Hell!

We're still pondering over the huge questions it poses for the future of Ichigo and his friends... ☆ The Saga of Tanya the Evil Season 2 Confirmed!We may not have any more details on Season 2 yet, but TOM News readers were clearly as pumped as we were to hear that Tanya will be back! Hopefully, we'll be hearing more soon. ☆ Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku Gets TV Anime Adaptation!Yuji Kaku's manga ended this January after a three-year run, but at least we won't be saying goodbye completely! Not to mention, the series will be animated by MAPPA, the studio behind hit series like  Jujutsu Kaisen and  Dorohedoro, not to mention the final season of  Attack on Titan.

I’ll continue doing everything I can to create an enjoyable story.   Summary   Around a decade ago, a gate appeared linking our world with an alternate dimension. And along with it, people called “Hunters” awakened. These Hunters earn their keep by defeating the monsters lurking inside the gate. But not all Hunters are powerful beings. One such person, E-Rank Hunter Sung JinWoo, known as the “World’s Weakest Hunter”, is reluctantly doing the job to pay for his mother’s hospital bills. One day, JinWoo happens to stumble upon a “double-layered” dungeon hidden within a D-Rank dungeon, and moments before his death, he’s granted special powers. A daily quest window only he can see…!? Only he knows the secret to leveling up… by completing quests and defeating monsters every day, he can level up…!? Just how high will his level get!?

Tokyo Anime News,"    The E-Sports Boom Inspires New Japanese Manga  Manga April 15, 09:49   0    #Game #e-sports #GuardianAngel #MangaBANG        If organizations like Cloud9 and Team Liquid are familiar to you, and gamer tags like SonicFox ring a bell, then you’re probably well-versed in the wild world of eSports.eSports, or e-sports, however you want to say it, obviously stands for electronic sports. Just as there’s professional competitive sports like basketball or baseball, it’s possible to be pro-level and compete in PC and video games. The organized gaming phenomenon has taken the entire world by storm over the last decade, with professional eSports teams rising up from just about every country you could think of. These international teams compete with one another to crown the best players in the world. Even traditional sports news networks like ESPN now televise eSports competitions. It would be foolish not to, as eSports is a multi-billion-dollar industry!To give you an idea of the excitement and fast-paced action that makes such a market boom, you can check out the following video. It’s a recent nail-biting match between Team Liquid and KRÜ in the Stage 1 Masters Valorant Champions Tour 2022.As you might expect, to be the top eSports team or eSports player requires intense training, just as traditional sports do. But the regimen is very different from the kind you find in say, soccer or hockey. A lot of eSports achievement focuses on precise and swift hand-eye coordination while using screens, keyboards and controllers. Communication between teammates, often through headsets, is also key. Leagues separated by gender are common in traditional sports, but eSports may be the competitive world that finally breaks away from that kind of division. CNN has recently reported about the Valorant Game Changers initiative, which aims to “provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players.” In a few years, the male-dominated eSports scene might not look the same.Which brings us to the recently released Japanese manga, Guardian Angel. Now available with English translation, Guardian Angel follows a female main character Akane Hinata. Akane transfers to Tomohana High and is quickly invited to join one of the school’s clubs - the General Course eSports Society. A manga about a girls’ eSports team like this has the potential to inspire females to go professional in eSports. Or, as with the Valorant Game Changers program, real life female gamers may inspire more representation of professional eSports females in popular new anime and manga works.    Guardian Angel introduces eSports to the reader by presenting everything through Akane’s eyes. She’s completely new to the world of eSports, so the reader can learn about the phenomenon as she does. But she also proves early on to show great potential for competitive gaming thanks to her amazing hand-eye coordination. You can see this in the first chapter, available on the Manga Flip app for free. Or watch the chapters in video form as they’re gradually released on the Manga Bang YouTube Channel.

Or, as with the Valorant Game Changers program, real life female gamers may inspire more representation of professional eSports females in popular new anime and manga works.    Guardian Angel introduces eSports to the reader by presenting everything through Akane’s eyes. She’s completely new to the world of eSports, so the reader can learn about the phenomenon as she does. But she also proves early on to show great potential for competitive gaming thanks to her amazing hand-eye coordination. You can see this in the first chapter, available on the Manga Flip app for free. Or watch the chapters in video form as they’re gradually released on the Manga Bang YouTube Channel.

21-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://anime-news.tokyo/news/the-e-sports-boom-inspires-new-japanese-manga,The E-Sports Boom Inspires New Japane... Tokyo Anime News," If organizations like Cloud9 and Team Liquid are familiar to you, and gamer tags like SonicFox ring a bell, then you’re probably well-versed in the wild world of eSports.eSports, or e-sports, however you want to say it, obviously stands for electronic sports. Just as there’s professional competitive sports like basketball or baseball, it’s possible to be pro-level and compete in PC and video games. The organized gaming phenomenon has taken the entire world by storm over the last decade, with professional eSports teams rising up from just about every country you could think of. These international teams compete with one another to crown the best players in the world. Even traditional sports news networks like ESPN now televise eSports competitions. It would be foolish not to, as eSports is a multi-billion-dollar industry!To give you an idea of the excitement and fast-paced action that makes such a market boom, you can check out the following video. It’s a recent nail-biting match between Team Liquid and KRÜ in the Stage 1 Masters Valorant Champions Tour 2022.As you might expect, to be the top eSports team or eSports player requires intense training, just as traditional sports do. But the regimen is very different from the kind you find in say, soccer or hockey. A lot of eSports achievement focuses on precise and swift hand-eye coordination while using screens, keyboards and controllers. Communication between teammates, often through headsets, is also key. Leagues separated by gender are common in traditional sports, but eSports may be the competitive world that finally breaks away from that kind of division. CNN has recently reported about the Valorant Game Changers initiative, which aims to “provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players.” In a few years, the male-dominated eSports scene might not look the same.Which brings us to the recently released Japanese manga, Guardian Angel. Now available with English translation, Guardian Angel follows a female main character Akane Hinata. Akane transfers to Tomohana High and is quickly invited to join one of the school’s clubs - the General Course eSports Society. A manga about a girls’ eSports team like this has the potential to inspire females to go professional in eSports. Or, as with the Valorant Game Changers program, real life female gamers may inspire more representation of professional eSports females in popular new anime and manga works.    Guardian Angel introduces eSports to the reader by presenting everything through Akane’s eyes. She’s completely new to the world of eSports, so the reader can learn about the phenomenon as she does. But she also proves early on to show great potential for competitive gaming thanks to her amazing hand-eye coordination.

21-04-2022,anime,9,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-49343280,Why I 'married' a cartoon character - BBC News,"BBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeWar in UkraineCoronavirusClimateVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceMoreStoriesEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsStoriesWhy I 'married' a cartoon characterPublished17 August 2019SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesThere is a word in Japanese for people who are obsessed with video games and anime - otaku. An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan's hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan's elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of 'came out',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he's open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He's working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku's written above the doorbell.And most importantly he's happy.""In this society there's a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family. But that shouldn't be the only way. I don't fall into that template. ""We have to consider all kinds of love and all kinds of happiness.""You may also be interested in:Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan's hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan's elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of 'came out',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he's open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He's working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku's written above the doorbell.And most importantly he's happy.""In this society there's a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family. But that shouldn't be the only way. I don't fall into that template. ""We have to consider all kinds of love and all kinds of happiness.""You may also be interested in:Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life.

21-04-2022,anime,9,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-49343280,Why I 'married' a cartoon character - BBC News,"Why I 'married' a cartoon characterPublished17 August 2019SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesThere is a word in Japanese for people who are obsessed with video games and anime - otaku. An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan's hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan's elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of 'came out',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he's open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He's working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku's written above the doorbell.And most importantly he's happy.""In this society there's a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family. But that shouldn't be the only way. I don't fall into that template. ""We have to consider all kinds of love and all kinds of happiness.""You may also be interested in:Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life.

In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Biden says war at critical point as he sends more weaponsWorking with assertive China a must: Jacinda ArdernPublished16 hours agoThe young rebels fighting for democracy.

A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Biden says war at critical point as he sends more weaponsWorking with assertive China a must: Jacinda ArdernPublished16 hours agoThe young rebels fighting for democracy.

In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday.

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time. Thank you KyoAni, for making my life a little more brighter. pic.twitter.com/bu1GB6VO59— Asher Edlin (@TheAfroOtaku) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""This company produced so many anime that helped shape me into who I am. Most of which were absolute masterpieces,"" wrote donor Darrian Harrison. ""KyoAni's works have been a part of my childhood,"" said LC Mendoza. Another donor, Mackenzie Haa, said Kyoto Animation ""is a model for the anime industry and deserves so much better than this.  I hope they come back stronger than ever after this tragedy"".Across the internet, fans are posting messages of condolence and support on discussion forums and message boards.Condolences to the staff at KyoAni https://t.co/1bdggx7ofd pic.twitter.com/NRR2u4aEdt— Maruse Rino (@maruse_rino) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThoughts with @kyoani!

Most of the tributes and concerns were targeted squarely at the staff who may have lost their lives and their families.But fans also lamented the potential artistic loss. ""Thousands of drawings, computers with important animation files. Whatever they currently have in the pipeline may be near or completely destroyed,"" one Reddit user wrote, though others argued backups must exist.Others posted links to well-known staff who had tweeted they were safe - or kept lists of those still missing.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Biden says war at critical point as he sends more weaponsWorking with assertive China a must: Jacinda ArdernPublished16 hours agoThe young rebels fighting for democracy.

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time. Thank you KyoAni, for making my life a little more brighter. pic.twitter.com/bu1GB6VO59— Asher Edlin (@TheAfroOtaku) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""This company produced so many anime that helped shape me into who I am.

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time.
