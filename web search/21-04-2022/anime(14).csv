Boichi stated that he had to stop it because ""something sad happened.""    Boichi launched the manga in Kodansha's Morning magazine on April 14.    Boichi (Sun-Ken Rock, Origin) and Riichirou Inagaki (author of Eyeshield 21) launched the Dr. Stone manga in Weekly Shonen Jump in March 2017, and ended the series on March 7. The manga will get a new chapter in Weekly Shonen Jump around the same time the Dr. Stone: Ryusui special airs this summer.    Viz Media is publishing the manga digitally and in print, and MANGA Plus is also publishing the manga digitally in English. The manga inspired two anime seasons as well as an upcoming anime special and an upcoming third season.

News GKIDS to Release Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water TV Anime With 4K Restoration   posted on 2022-04-20 23:46 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Company to release series directed by Evangelion's Hideaki Anno on home video    GKIDS announced on Wednesday that it has acquired the North American rights for Gainax's science-fiction adventure anime Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water, and it will release the series on home video, based on a new 4K restoration.    GKIDS describes the story:   It's 1889 and people from around the globe are flocking to Paris to see scientific achievements at the Exposition Universelle despite rumors of dangers lurking in the oceans. While attending the fair, teenaged inventor Jean meets Nadia, a mysterious girl who possesses a highly sought-after crystal called Blue Water. Pursued by nefarious forces, the pair journey by sea and by sky to escape their would-be captors and to discover the secret of the crystal.   The staff featured director Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion, His and Her Circumstances), character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honnêamise, Evangelion, Summer Wars), sound director Katsunori Shimizu (Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee, Fushigi Yugi), and musical composer Shiro Sagisu (Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Evangelion).    Sentai Filmworks previously released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The anime was previously released on video tape by Streamline Pictures, and on video tape and DVD by ADV Films.

GKIDS describes the story:   It's 1889 and people from around the globe are flocking to Paris to see scientific achievements at the Exposition Universelle despite rumors of dangers lurking in the oceans. While attending the fair, teenaged inventor Jean meets Nadia, a mysterious girl who possesses a highly sought-after crystal called Blue Water. Pursued by nefarious forces, the pair journey by sea and by sky to escape their would-be captors and to discover the secret of the crystal.   The staff featured director Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion, His and Her Circumstances), character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honnêamise, Evangelion, Summer Wars), sound director Katsunori Shimizu (Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee, Fushigi Yugi), and musical composer Shiro Sagisu (Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Evangelion).    Sentai Filmworks previously released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The anime was previously released on video tape by Streamline Pictures, and on video tape and DVD by ADV Films.

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

As anyone who has been in development knows, this is the crap that comes out when someone from Corp says ""hey, this fujioshi (sic) thing is taking off, we need to be in that market"", then development says, ""we do sci-fi games, we don't do dating sims"", to which the reply goes ""just throw in some mean chicks and pretty boys and get it done ASAP"".  So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.

I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column          2 comments       This Week in Anime - What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

As anyone who has been in development knows, this is the crap that comes out when someone from Corp says ""hey, this fujioshi (sic) thing is taking off, we need to be in that market"", then development says, ""we do sci-fi games, we don't do dating sims"", to which the reply goes ""just throw in some mean chicks and pretty boys and get it done ASAP"".  So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 832       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column          2 comments       This Week in Anime - What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?

REVIEW: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        jdnation    Joined: 15 May 2007 		    Posts: 1590       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 3:53 pm            In a sea of mediocre isekais, so far this one is one of the good ones. I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 832       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column          2 comments       This Week in Anime - What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column          2 comments       This Week in Anime - What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 832       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.phpbb.com/': 1}"

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.

The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.phpbb.com/': 1}"

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 832       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"".

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group    ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.phpbb.com/': 1}"

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

REVIEW: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs [1/2] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," After reading the first 5 translated novels I've become a real fan of this series. It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be.

Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect.
