That's quite the insult, the GFL anime was quite the disaster, in text form yes it seems quite weak, but it being animated can definitely bring more excitement and fix that.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there. And of course, they can always add in more info to have the viewer understand what's going on, which is more likely. I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

That's quite the insult, the GFL anime was quite the disaster, in text form yes it seems quite weak, but it being animated can definitely bring more excitement and fix that.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there. And of course, they can always add in more info to have the viewer understand what's going on, which is more likely. I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

That's quite the insult, the GFL anime was quite the disaster, in text form yes it seems quite weak, but it being animated can definitely bring more excitement and fix that.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there.

I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

Easy to say it will be on the same level as GFL anime, if not even worse.

That's quite the insult, the GFL anime was quite the disaster, in text form yes it seems quite weak, but it being animated can definitely bring more excitement and fix that.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there. And of course, they can always add in more info to have the viewer understand what's going on, which is more likely. I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future. There's a LOT of heart-shaped pupils in this book, if you know what I mean. But that all ultimately gels with the humor and energy of the rest of the jokes, and since everyone here is very obviously enjoying themselves, I can't complain. Just maybe don't read this in polite company.    100 Girlfriends is a premise that, by any metric, should not work. But through a sharp sense of humor, writing that 1000% commits to the bit, and excellent art, it doesn't just work: it excels. If you're a fan of more typical romcoms, you're likely to get a kick out of it, but even if you hate harem series, it may just manage worm its way into your heart through confidence alone.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future. There's a LOT of heart-shaped pupils in this book, if you know what I mean. But that all ultimately gels with the humor and energy of the rest of the jokes, and since everyone here is very obviously enjoying themselves, I can't complain. Just maybe don't read this in polite company.    100 Girlfriends is a premise that, by any metric, should not work. But through a sharp sense of humor, writing that 1000% commits to the bit, and excellent art, it doesn't just work: it excels. If you're a fan of more typical romcoms, you're likely to get a kick out of it, but even if you hate harem series, it may just manage worm its way into your heart through confidence alone.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future. There's a LOT of heart-shaped pupils in this book, if you know what I mean. But that all ultimately gels with the humor and energy of the rest of the jokes, and since everyone here is very obviously enjoying themselves, I can't complain. Just maybe don't read this in polite company.    100 Girlfriends is a premise that, by any metric, should not work. But through a sharp sense of humor, writing that 1000% commits to the bit, and excellent art, it doesn't just work: it excels. If you're a fan of more typical romcoms, you're likely to get a kick out of it, but even if you hate harem series, it may just manage worm its way into your heart through confidence alone.             Grade:      Overall : A Story : B+ Art : A  + Great and clever comedy, expressive character art, knows exactly what it's doing even if it shouldn't work − Can feel like playing inside baseball with the harem genre, may be too horny for some            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history       				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Rikito Nakamura   Art: Yukiko Nozawa   Full encyclopedia details about100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.
