The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency.

But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that?

Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued.

Is Aharen San supposed to be viewed as being on the autism spectrum?

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Is Aharen San supposed to be viewed as being on the autism spectrum? Because a lot of her behavior reminds me a lot of people who are on the spectrum      Back to top                   MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3973       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 11:36 am            This show is really sold on the comedic interplay between Raido and Aharen, with Raid's wholesome personality, ditziness, and flights of fancy, and Aharen being so stoic, exaggerated, and yet oddly sweet. Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Dragon Ball Z went to some extraordinary lengths to keep Goku out of its conflicts until the very end, all the while doing whatever it took to ensure said conflict lasted long enough for him to wrap up whatever was keeping him out of the fight. Goku spent most of his time in DBZ either training, dead, on his way, ill, or some combination of the four.  The series' infamous ""wait for Goku"" trope has created issues for other characters, whether it be a forced lack of intelligence or plot-required weakness -- but perhaps the most egregious plot hole created by this narrative trend was Krillin's time on Namek during Dragon Ball Z's ""Frieza"" Saga. RELATED: Dragon Ball Z: Why Did Frieza Let the Ginyu Force Pose and Act Silly?                 Krillin himself fell to the wayside almost immediately once DBZ began, with Raditz using just his tail to slap Krillin through a house. Goku's closest friend and biggest rival struggled to remain relevant, accomplishing next to nothing during DBZ despite possessing two of the (objectively) most powerful techniques in the series.  While Krillin's Destructo Disc -- which consists of a blade of energy that can cut through anything -- is his own creation, he has also borrowed fellow Z Fighter Tien Shinhan's signature move on a number of occasions. The Solar Flare is low-key the franchise's most unstoppable technique that, frankly, should be used far more often than it is given its 100% success rate. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Fans Applaud Bardock's Badass Attitude in Latest Manga Chapter The fact that Krillin is capable of using both of these techniques means that, despite being the franchise's most powerful villain at that point, Frieza should've been light work. The Solar Flare is so unstoppable because people witnessing it for the first time, like Frieza, have no idea what's coming -- while the people who do know what it is have inexplicably never thought to just close their eyes. The blinding power of this attack used by someone as weak as Krillin was still completely debilitating to someone as powerful as Frieza, yet he failed to capitalize on an incredible opportunity when he used the Solar Flare against the evil space emperor.  As his dependence on Scouters proved, Frieza was unable to sense Ki during the ""Namek"" Saga. This means that after being blinded and writhing in agony from the Solar Flare, a well-placed Destructo Disc would've been the end of this arc because Frieza wouldn't have known the attack was coming. RELATED: Dragon Ball Z: Would Nail Have Defeated Vegeta If They'd Fought on Namek?                 Some villains, like Cell, are powerful enough to withstand a Destructo Disc without injury, but Frieza wasn't that strong. Indeed, Krillin used the attack and successfully cut off Frieza's tail; coupled with the villain's demise at the hands of his own version of the technique, therein lies the proof that Frieza would've been vulnerable to a Solar Flare-Destructo Disc combo attack from the series' most disrespected character.  Frieza's arrogance -- especially where someone as weak as Krillin was concerned -- was more than enough to be his undoing despite his being vastly more powerful than anyone else on Namek. Krillin's missed opportunity to outmaneuver the greatest villain to that point isn't a blemish on his character so much as it's indicative of the ""wait for Goku"" trope. Doing whatever it takes to stall for time until the hero shows up at the last minute to save the day, unfortunately, requires other characters to be forced to make critical mistakes for the plot to continue. That said, perhaps Krillin simply didn't think of a Solar Flare-Destructo Disc combo. Hindsight is 20/20, and who among us hasn't looked back at something and thought ""oh, that would've been a good idea."" Fighting an evil space emperor hundreds of times stronger on an alien planet is probably really stressful, so Krillin can surely be forgiven for his lapse in judgment. Things worked out anyway as the Dragon Balls revived everyone whom Frieza and his men killed, so no harm no foul for Krillin.

25-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-krillin-solar-flare-destructo-disc-frieza/,Dragon Ball Z: How Krillin Could've Defeated Frieza on Namek,"      Home Anime Dragon Ball Z: Why Krillin Could've Been the One to Beat Frieza – Easily    Dragon Ball Z: Why Krillin Could've Been the One to Beat Frieza – Easily  By Ryan McCarthy Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Frieza was nearly unstoppable during DBZ's Namek saga, but he could've been stopped easily - if Krillin had better critical thinking skills.                 Dragon Ball Z went to some extraordinary lengths to keep Goku out of its conflicts until the very end, all the while doing whatever it took to ensure said conflict lasted long enough for him to wrap up whatever was keeping him out of the fight. Goku spent most of his time in DBZ either training, dead, on his way, ill, or some combination of the four.  The series' infamous ""wait for Goku"" trope has created issues for other characters, whether it be a forced lack of intelligence or plot-required weakness -- but perhaps the most egregious plot hole created by this narrative trend was Krillin's time on Namek during Dragon Ball Z's ""Frieza"" Saga. RELATED: Dragon Ball Z: Why Did Frieza Let the Ginyu Force Pose and Act Silly?                 Krillin himself fell to the wayside almost immediately once DBZ began, with Raditz using just his tail to slap Krillin through a house. Goku's closest friend and biggest rival struggled to remain relevant, accomplishing next to nothing during DBZ despite possessing two of the (objectively) most powerful techniques in the series.  While Krillin's Destructo Disc -- which consists of a blade of energy that can cut through anything -- is his own creation, he has also borrowed fellow Z Fighter Tien Shinhan's signature move on a number of occasions. The Solar Flare is low-key the franchise's most unstoppable technique that, frankly, should be used far more often than it is given its 100% success rate. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Fans Applaud Bardock's Badass Attitude in Latest Manga Chapter The fact that Krillin is capable of using both of these techniques means that, despite being the franchise's most powerful villain at that point, Frieza should've been light work. The Solar Flare is so unstoppable because people witnessing it for the first time, like Frieza, have no idea what's coming -- while the people who do know what it is have inexplicably never thought to just close their eyes. The blinding power of this attack used by someone as weak as Krillin was still completely debilitating to someone as powerful as Frieza, yet he failed to capitalize on an incredible opportunity when he used the Solar Flare against the evil space emperor.  As his dependence on Scouters proved, Frieza was unable to sense Ki during the ""Namek"" Saga. This means that after being blinded and writhing in agony from the Solar Flare, a well-placed Destructo Disc would've been the end of this arc because Frieza wouldn't have known the attack was coming. RELATED: Dragon Ball Z: Would Nail Have Defeated Vegeta If They'd Fought on Namek?                 Some villains, like Cell, are powerful enough to withstand a Destructo Disc without injury, but Frieza wasn't that strong. Indeed, Krillin used the attack and successfully cut off Frieza's tail; coupled with the villain's demise at the hands of his own version of the technique, therein lies the proof that Frieza would've been vulnerable to a Solar Flare-Destructo Disc combo attack from the series' most disrespected character.  Frieza's arrogance -- especially where someone as weak as Krillin was concerned -- was more than enough to be his undoing despite his being vastly more powerful than anyone else on Namek. Krillin's missed opportunity to outmaneuver the greatest villain to that point isn't a blemish on his character so much as it's indicative of the ""wait for Goku"" trope. Doing whatever it takes to stall for time until the hero shows up at the last minute to save the day, unfortunately, requires other characters to be forced to make critical mistakes for the plot to continue. That said, perhaps Krillin simply didn't think of a Solar Flare-Destructo Disc combo. Hindsight is 20/20, and who among us hasn't looked back at something and thought ""oh, that would've been a good idea."" Fighting an evil space emperor hundreds of times stronger on an alien planet is probably really stressful, so Krillin can surely be forgiven for his lapse in judgment. Things worked out anyway as the Dragon Balls revived everyone whom Frieza and his men killed, so no harm no foul for Krillin.

The following contains spoilers for Doron Dororon Chapter 19, ""Real Superheroes,"" by Gen Oosuka, Camellia Nieh and Phil Christie, available in English at Viz and Manga Plus.   The monsters called Mononoke have always been regarded as the evil entities in the world of Doron Dororon. While Kusanagi's existence is proof that not all of them are evil, Dora's partner is more the exception than the rule, especially since the series' latest biggest threats are Humanoid Mononoke.  The Humanoid Mononoke were introduced as savage and powerful monsters that could easily eliminate Hanya Gyuuki, a Mononoke that was considered disastrous. Although they possess power that could wipe out most Samurai, they were still shown to be weaker than a Samurai Officer. However, Chapter 19 of Doron Dororon reveals that there's at least one Humanoid Mononoke who not only possesses terrifying might but also conniving wit. RELATED:Doron Dororon's Most Unpredictable Character Solves Dora and Kusanagi's Problem                 Despite facing three Humanoid Mononoke and receiving their combined attack, Heisuke Ujii surprisingly still survived the encounter -- though not without injuries. He was taken into headquarters and got back on his feet just after three days. The Samurai were in a celebratory mood after their clear victory, and Kusanagi even found itself a bunch of fans. But while they are enjoying and recuperating, shady characters have been plotting against them elsewhere.  Chapter 19 of Doron Dororon shows two silhouettes discussing the Mononoke's plans and the failure of their recent operation. This is when it's revealed that Hidehisa, Tameemon and Yoshihime were mere pawns and proceeded to discuss Dora and Kusanagi's peculiar ability, which they now coveted to break a certain seal. Subsequent panels then revealed that one of the two silhouettes -- and the one referred to as master -- was Kanbeh, while the other was a so-called Samurai. RELATED:Is Doron Dororon Going Too Fast?                 Although the Humanoid Mononoke formulated the plan to lure Samurai Officers, it's not necessarily noteworthy or groundbreaking. Even then, Kanbeh seemed to be the brain behind the operation. However, his new plan of acquiring and using Dora and Kusanagi's peculiar ability proves he is more sinister than he first appeared.  The fact that Kanbeh has a Samurai working under him, be it through legitimate subordination or trickery, means he has already been carefully planning and operating for a certain time now. He was also strong enough to escape the fight with Ujii unscathed, an event that killed all the other Humanoid Mononoke. Ujii defeating Hidehisa and company proved how powerful he is but also revealed Kanbeh's true threat level. The Humanoid Mononoke not only survived after confronting the strongest Samurai, but it is also revealed that he already has a mole planted within the Samurai Forces.

25-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/doron-dororon-chapter-19-spoilers-kanbeh-cunning-villain/,Doron Dororon's Kanbeh Is Its Strongest and Most Cunning Villain Yet,"      Home Anime Doron Dororon Reveals Its Strongest and Most Cunning Villain Yet    Doron Dororon Reveals Its Strongest and Most Cunning Villain Yet  By Christian Markle Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Most of Doron Dororon's villains are shown to possess an immense amount of power, but Chapter 19 reveals one of them has more evil to offer.                  The following contains spoilers for Doron Dororon Chapter 19, ""Real Superheroes,"" by Gen Oosuka, Camellia Nieh and Phil Christie, available in English at Viz and Manga Plus.   The monsters called Mononoke have always been regarded as the evil entities in the world of Doron Dororon. While Kusanagi's existence is proof that not all of them are evil, Dora's partner is more the exception than the rule, especially since the series' latest biggest threats are Humanoid Mononoke.  The Humanoid Mononoke were introduced as savage and powerful monsters that could easily eliminate Hanya Gyuuki, a Mononoke that was considered disastrous. Although they possess power that could wipe out most Samurai, they were still shown to be weaker than a Samurai Officer. However, Chapter 19 of Doron Dororon reveals that there's at least one Humanoid Mononoke who not only possesses terrifying might but also conniving wit. RELATED:Doron Dororon's Most Unpredictable Character Solves Dora and Kusanagi's Problem                 Despite facing three Humanoid Mononoke and receiving their combined attack, Heisuke Ujii surprisingly still survived the encounter -- though not without injuries. He was taken into headquarters and got back on his feet just after three days. The Samurai were in a celebratory mood after their clear victory, and Kusanagi even found itself a bunch of fans. But while they are enjoying and recuperating, shady characters have been plotting against them elsewhere.  Chapter 19 of Doron Dororon shows two silhouettes discussing the Mononoke's plans and the failure of their recent operation. This is when it's revealed that Hidehisa, Tameemon and Yoshihime were mere pawns and proceeded to discuss Dora and Kusanagi's peculiar ability, which they now coveted to break a certain seal. Subsequent panels then revealed that one of the two silhouettes -- and the one referred to as master -- was Kanbeh, while the other was a so-called Samurai. RELATED:Is Doron Dororon Going Too Fast?                 Although the Humanoid Mononoke formulated the plan to lure Samurai Officers, it's not necessarily noteworthy or groundbreaking. Even then, Kanbeh seemed to be the brain behind the operation. However, his new plan of acquiring and using Dora and Kusanagi's peculiar ability proves he is more sinister than he first appeared.  The fact that Kanbeh has a Samurai working under him, be it through legitimate subordination or trickery, means he has already been carefully planning and operating for a certain time now. He was also strong enough to escape the fight with Ujii unscathed, an event that killed all the other Humanoid Mononoke. Ujii defeating Hidehisa and company proved how powerful he is but also revealed Kanbeh's true threat level. The Humanoid Mononoke not only survived after confronting the strongest Samurai, but it is also revealed that he already has a mole planted within the Samurai Forces. Moving forward, the Samurai in Doron Dororon will be facing a threat that requires more than just brute force to eliminate.

Here’s how to get started with this timeless series.                   The following article contains brief discussion of sexual and psychological abuse.   Written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida, Banana Fish may seem like your average shojo series centering on a male lead. However, with a violent storyline and well-developed characters, the story offers a bloody tale of crime, friendship, and revenge. Although Banana Fish was first published in Bessatsu Shojo Comic magazine, the series has achieved crossover success between the audiences of shojo and shonen manga.  It's been over 30 years since the New York gang scene graced the written pages, but in 2018 Banana Fish received an anime adaptation and regained popularity along with classics such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Ashita no Joe. While the show is still in its second springtime, here's how newcomers and veterans like can read and watch the series. RELATED: Carole & Tuesday: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          The Plot of Banana Fish                Set in the tumultuous streets of 1980s New York, Banana Fish revolves around the intelligent and beautiful gang leader Aslan Jade Callenreese, aka Ash Lynx. When Ash was a child, he was picked off the streets and raised by the notorious crime boss Dino ‘Papa’ Golzine. After years of sexual and psychological abuse, he turned into a ruthless murderer and became the boss of his own gang. After a series of murders, Ash begins to investigate the mysterious “banana fish” -- a phrase Ash’s older brother has uttered since coming back from the Vietnam/Iraq War.   Surrounded by the chaos and gang wars, Ash befriends a pure-hearted Japanese photography assistant named Eiji Okumura. The two soon begin to develop an intangible friendship that they decide to protect at any cost. With a well-written plot, Banana Fish is a tragic fairytale that centers on two kindred spirits embarking on a dangerous journey. RELATED: Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels          Where to Read the Banana Fish Manga                 Banana Fish was first serialized in Bessatsu Shojo Comic magazine from 1985-1994 and comprised 110 chapters. These individual chapters were later published into 19 volumes by Shogakukan. The English version of the series has been localized by Viz Media.  For those who prefer to read physical copies, they are available for purchase at many book retailers and wherever manga is sold, including Barnes & Noble, Amazon, Walmart, Books-a-Million and RightStufAnime. For fans who prefer to own digital copies of their manga, many of the same retailers sell an e-book version as well. RELATED: Dance Dance Danseur: Will Junpei Land the Role of Prince - or White Swan?          Where to Watch the Banana Fish Anime                The 24-episode anime adaptation of Banana Fish began airing in July 2018, more than 20 years after the manga ended. The series was animated by MAPPA, the well-known studio behind magnificent works such as Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuri!!! On Ice and Dororo. The anime was produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Akimi Yoshida’s debut as a mangaka.  Due to the setting revision -- from the 1980s to the 2010s -- some changes were made in the anime adaptation. Placing smartphones and changing the Vietnam War to the Iraq War were only a few, and there are more. Currently there is no official Blu-ray release for the series in the West, so the only way to watch Banana Fish is through the Prime Video streaming service.

25-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.cbr.com/banana-fish-where-watch-anime-read-manga/,Where to Watch & Read Banana Fish,"      Home Anime Banana Fish: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga    Banana Fish: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga  By Revna Altiok Published 14 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Banana Fish broadens shojo's territory with a story full of danger, drama, and friendship. Here’s how to get started with this timeless series.                   The following article contains brief discussion of sexual and psychological abuse.   Written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida, Banana Fish may seem like your average shojo series centering on a male lead. However, with a violent storyline and well-developed characters, the story offers a bloody tale of crime, friendship, and revenge. Although Banana Fish was first published in Bessatsu Shojo Comic magazine, the series has achieved crossover success between the audiences of shojo and shonen manga.  It's been over 30 years since the New York gang scene graced the written pages, but in 2018 Banana Fish received an anime adaptation and regained popularity along with classics such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Ashita no Joe. While the show is still in its second springtime, here's how newcomers and veterans like can read and watch the series. RELATED: Carole & Tuesday: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          The Plot of Banana Fish                Set in the tumultuous streets of 1980s New York, Banana Fish revolves around the intelligent and beautiful gang leader Aslan Jade Callenreese, aka Ash Lynx. When Ash was a child, he was picked off the streets and raised by the notorious crime boss Dino ‘Papa’ Golzine. After years of sexual and psychological abuse, he turned into a ruthless murderer and became the boss of his own gang. After a series of murders, Ash begins to investigate the mysterious “banana fish” -- a phrase Ash’s older brother has uttered since coming back from the Vietnam/Iraq War.   Surrounded by the chaos and gang wars, Ash befriends a pure-hearted Japanese photography assistant named Eiji Okumura. The two soon begin to develop an intangible friendship that they decide to protect at any cost. With a well-written plot, Banana Fish is a tragic fairytale that centers on two kindred spirits embarking on a dangerous journey. RELATED: Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels          Where to Read the Banana Fish Manga                 Banana Fish was first serialized in Bessatsu Shojo Comic magazine from 1985-1994 and comprised 110 chapters. These individual chapters were later published into 19 volumes by Shogakukan. The English version of the series has been localized by Viz Media.  For those who prefer to read physical copies, they are available for purchase at many book retailers and wherever manga is sold, including Barnes & Noble, Amazon, Walmart, Books-a-Million and RightStufAnime. For fans who prefer to own digital copies of their manga, many of the same retailers sell an e-book version as well. RELATED: Dance Dance Danseur: Will Junpei Land the Role of Prince - or White Swan?          Where to Watch the Banana Fish Anime                The 24-episode anime adaptation of Banana Fish began airing in July 2018, more than 20 years after the manga ended. The series was animated by MAPPA, the well-known studio behind magnificent works such as Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuri!!! On Ice and Dororo. The anime was produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Akimi Yoshida’s debut as a mangaka.  Due to the setting revision -- from the 1980s to the 2010s -- some changes were made in the anime adaptation. Placing smartphones and changing the Vietnam War to the Iraq War were only a few, and there are more. Currently there is no official Blu-ray release for the series in the West, so the only way to watch Banana Fish is through the Prime Video streaming service.

Avatar: The Last Airbender managed to convey not only a sweeping and epic story but did so while balancing character development for every member of its main cast. Nearly everyone received their own story arc, learning and growing throughout the series, and the earthbending master Toph Beifong was no exception.  However, Toph did seem to receive the short end of the stick when it came to narrative space reserved for her growth compared to her fellow teammates. Luckily, the Avatar franchise more than made up for lost time in subsequent projects, with sequels such as The Legend of Korra, the comics and Avatar Legends all expanding on her growth until she became one of the most dynamic characters in the entire franchise. Related: Avatar Legends: What Was Wan Shi Tong's Library Like Before Aang?                Avatar received much acclaim for the development of its core cast, with each member of Team Avatar undergoing massive changes that paradoxically retained the core of their character throughout the original series. Zuko's redemption arc is regarded as one of the best in the history of animation. Aang's hero's journey toward finally accepting his responsibilities to the world proved a constant struggle. Katara and Sokka likewise underwent growth of their own, with Sokka overcoming his sexism and immaturity as Katara came into her own as a confident and capable idealist.  By comparison, Toph was always just Toph. There's no doubting that she underwent some amount of development from her introduction in Season 2 to the series' finale in the following season. Brash and independent, Toph came to increasingly accept help from her friends and to let down her guard to let others close. However, whereas the others received entire episodes dedicated to their development, and these developments were in many cases massive shifts in their identity, Toph's arc proved far subtler. Related: Avatar's Ba Sing Se Changed Forever After the Red Lotus - But How? Conversely, in the time that followed the original series, Toph founded her own Metalbending Academy in order to spread the knowledge of the bending art she invented to the world. Her motivation for doing so, discussed in the comic The Promise, was said to be that teaching Aang to earthbend and having such a massive impact on the world helped her to discover how important being a teacher was to her. In learning to train her first students, Toph came to view her own upbringing under harsh and demanding authority figures and to grow from that experience. The comics flesh out her relationship with her students well as Toph grows more comfortable in that role.  By The Legend of Korra, decades after the timeline of the original series, Toph became the Chief of Police of Republic City -- a development that left many fans feeling that her character did an about-face out of nowhere. Going from a rebellious teenager constantly uncomfortable with structure and authority to the very head of institutional authority in Republic City seemed like a drastic development to take place off-screen, but the truth is that readers of the comics see that evolution occur more and more as Toph grows into the leader she would become. Related: Avatar: What Was Book 1's Most Beautifully Animated Episode?                 By the time Korra met Toph for herself, she was long since retired and living as a recluse in the Foggy Swamp. Still her cantankerous and coarse self, her willingness to apologize to her daughters and grow closer to them as a family stood out as a testament to just how much more mature Toph became over the intervening years. Toph was certainly never perfect, and she was the first to admit her faults. However, rather than assuming that Toph's character development was missing or unexplained, once anyone who pays attention starts putting the pieces together, it turns out that Toph's journey since Avatar: The Last Airbender has been absolutely amazing.

25-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-toph-best-character-growth/,Toph Grew More In Avatar Sequels Than Ever Before,"      Home Anime Toph's Character Growth Since The Last Airbender Is Greater Than Any Other    Toph's Character Growth Since The Last Airbender Is Greater Than Any Other  By Brenton Stewart Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Toph never grew much in the original series, but she made up for lost time in every Avatar project since.                 Avatar: The Last Airbender managed to convey not only a sweeping and epic story but did so while balancing character development for every member of its main cast. Nearly everyone received their own story arc, learning and growing throughout the series, and the earthbending master Toph Beifong was no exception.  However, Toph did seem to receive the short end of the stick when it came to narrative space reserved for her growth compared to her fellow teammates. Luckily, the Avatar franchise more than made up for lost time in subsequent projects, with sequels such as The Legend of Korra, the comics and Avatar Legends all expanding on her growth until she became one of the most dynamic characters in the entire franchise. Related: Avatar Legends: What Was Wan Shi Tong's Library Like Before Aang?                Avatar received much acclaim for the development of its core cast, with each member of Team Avatar undergoing massive changes that paradoxically retained the core of their character throughout the original series. Zuko's redemption arc is regarded as one of the best in the history of animation. Aang's hero's journey toward finally accepting his responsibilities to the world proved a constant struggle. Katara and Sokka likewise underwent growth of their own, with Sokka overcoming his sexism and immaturity as Katara came into her own as a confident and capable idealist.  By comparison, Toph was always just Toph. There's no doubting that she underwent some amount of development from her introduction in Season 2 to the series' finale in the following season. Brash and independent, Toph came to increasingly accept help from her friends and to let down her guard to let others close. However, whereas the others received entire episodes dedicated to their development, and these developments were in many cases massive shifts in their identity, Toph's arc proved far subtler. Related: Avatar's Ba Sing Se Changed Forever After the Red Lotus - But How? Conversely, in the time that followed the original series, Toph founded her own Metalbending Academy in order to spread the knowledge of the bending art she invented to the world. Her motivation for doing so, discussed in the comic The Promise, was said to be that teaching Aang to earthbend and having such a massive impact on the world helped her to discover how important being a teacher was to her. In learning to train her first students, Toph came to view her own upbringing under harsh and demanding authority figures and to grow from that experience. The comics flesh out her relationship with her students well as Toph grows more comfortable in that role.  By The Legend of Korra, decades after the timeline of the original series, Toph became the Chief of Police of Republic City -- a development that left many fans feeling that her character did an about-face out of nowhere. Going from a rebellious teenager constantly uncomfortable with structure and authority to the very head of institutional authority in Republic City seemed like a drastic development to take place off-screen, but the truth is that readers of the comics see that evolution occur more and more as Toph grows into the leader she would become. Related: Avatar: What Was Book 1's Most Beautifully Animated Episode?                 By the time Korra met Toph for herself, she was long since retired and living as a recluse in the Foggy Swamp. Still her cantankerous and coarse self, her willingness to apologize to her daughters and grow closer to them as a family stood out as a testament to just how much more mature Toph became over the intervening years. Toph was certainly never perfect, and she was the first to admit her faults. However, rather than assuming that Toph's character development was missing or unexplained, once anyone who pays attention starts putting the pieces together, it turns out that Toph's journey since Avatar: The Last Airbender has been absolutely amazing.

One talented Studio Ghibli fan has created an epic cross-stitch portrait of one of Princess Mononoke's most deadly characters.  The portrait of San was uploaded to Reddit by the account Artonauts, and showcases the character's iconic facial markings and mask. According to the creator, they drew the pattern themselves, and their artwork is heavily inspired by ""90s games pixel art."" Cross-stitch portraits of other popular anime characters like Sailor Moon and Ryuko from Kill al Kill can be found on the account as well. RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover   Princess Mononoke portrait, by me from       ghibli    A form of counted-thread embroidery, cross-stitch is increasingly becoming a popular medium for fans to express their love and passion for pop culture properties. It involves using x-shaped stitches in a tiled pattern to form an image; the stitcher counts the individual threads on their piece of evenweave fabric (i.e., aida cloth, linen or needlepoint canvas) to make sure their stitches remain consistent in appearance and size.  Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke made its debut in Japan in 1997; it was released in the United States in 1999 with an English script by Neil Gaiman. Set in the Muromachi period of Japan, the story follows Ashitaka, a young prince of the Emishi people, who becomes involved in a struggle between gods and humans. The film grossed over $160 million at the global box office and won several prestigious awards, including Picture of the Year at the 21st Japan Academy Awards and Best Film at the 52nd Mainichi Film Awards. RELATED: Electrifying Pokémon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech  Many of the narrative elements of Princess Mononoke are similar to those in one of Miyazaki's earlier works -- a graphic novel titled Shuna's Journey, which was first published in Japan in 1983. The novel is set in a small mountain valley and follows the titular prince who sets forth on a journey to find a magical grain that may save his people from a deadly famine. The first-ever English release of Shuna's Journey is scheduled to hit stores on Nov. 1. Princess Mononoke is one of the movies featured in this year's Studio Ghibli Fest. It kicked off the annual event earlier this month, playing in theaters on April, 3, 4 and 6. The other movies included in the lineup are Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Kiki's Delivery Service, Ponyo, The Cat Returns and Only Yesterday.  Many iconic and beloved films by Studio Ghibli, including Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo and Spirited Away, are available to stream on HBO Max.

One talented Studio Ghibli fan has created an epic cross-stitch portrait of one of Princess Mononoke's most deadly characters.  The portrait of San was uploaded to Reddit by the account Artonauts, and showcases the character's iconic facial markings and mask. According to the creator, they drew the pattern themselves, and their artwork is heavily inspired by ""90s games pixel art."" Cross-stitch portraits of other popular anime characters like Sailor Moon and Ryuko from Kill al Kill can be found on the account as well. RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover   Princess Mononoke portrait, by me from       ghibli    A form of counted-thread embroidery, cross-stitch is increasingly becoming a popular medium for fans to express their love and passion for pop culture properties. It involves using x-shaped stitches in a tiled pattern to form an image; the stitcher counts the individual threads on their piece of evenweave fabric (i.e., aida cloth, linen or needlepoint canvas) to make sure their stitches remain consistent in appearance and size.  Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke made its debut in Japan in 1997; it was released in the United States in 1999 with an English script by Neil Gaiman. Set in the Muromachi period of Japan, the story follows Ashitaka, a young prince of the Emishi people, who becomes involved in a struggle between gods and humans. The film grossed over $160 million at the global box office and won several prestigious awards, including Picture of the Year at the 21st Japan Academy Awards and Best Film at the 52nd Mainichi Film Awards. RELATED: Electrifying Pokémon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech  Many of the narrative elements of Princess Mononoke are similar to those in one of Miyazaki's earlier works -- a graphic novel titled Shuna's Journey, which was first published in Japan in 1983. The novel is set in a small mountain valley and follows the titular prince who sets forth on a journey to find a magical grain that may save his people from a deadly famine. The first-ever English release of Shuna's Journey is scheduled to hit stores on Nov. 1. Princess Mononoke is one of the movies featured in this year's Studio Ghibli Fest. It kicked off the annual event earlier this month, playing in theaters on April, 3, 4 and 6. The other movies included in the lineup are Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Kiki's Delivery Service, Ponyo, The Cat Returns and Only Yesterday.  Many iconic and beloved films by Studio Ghibli, including Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo and Spirited Away, are available to stream on HBO Max.

But as Trapped in a Dating Sim proves, the characters involved are often doomed to misery.                 Trapped in a Dating Sim is a brand new isekai anime title of the Spring 2022 anime season, joining the ranks of video game-based series such as My Next Life as a Villainess and Overlord. Curiously, Dating Sim's underdog protagonist Leon Bartfort finds himself in, of all things, an otome game setting with some Final Fanasy combat elements thrown in.  The series promises some sci-fi/fantasy action in future episodes, but for now its focus remains on the otome game element, where Leon must navigate a female-dominated world where relationships and personal influence mean everything. All this shows how much some gamers underestimate the hidden dark side of otome games in general. RELATED: How Trapped in a Dating Sim Blends Shield Hero With My Next Life as a Villainess          The Dark Side Of Otome Games In Isekai Anime                It is easy for any gamer in real life or an anime series to appreciate the perks of being a video game hero. The story's events will usually unfold favorably and give them a happily-ever-after, since games are a form of escapism where the player is supposed to win after overcoming fun challenges. However, events are not so fun for the side characters, who might end up getting killed or at least have their plans and personal lives derailed. But the player has no reason to care, as long as they get what they want.  Game-based isekai anime such as My Next Life as a Villainess and Trapped in a Dating Sim change all that by thrusting the hapless hero into an otome game world as a side character -- or even as the cruel villainess instead. This forces the heroes to view the game world in a whole new light, and they have little to no plot armor protecting them. In fact, Villainess protagonist Katarina Claes had doom flags bearing down on her -- the inverse of plot armor -- and strove to reinvent everyone's social lives to avert her bad ending. Similarly, Dating Sim's Leon was reborn not as the heroine Olivia, but a generic thirdborn son, aka a backgorund character. He has no plot armor or prestige to his name and can see for himself how nasty the events of otome games can be.  RELATED: These Literary Classics Prove That Isekai Isn’t Only a Japanese Thing                 Once the otome heroine gets her happily ever after, it's easy to forget the hardships and perils of being a side character, such as a rejected lover or a defeated villainess. Just like My Next Life as a Villainess, Trapped in a Dating Sim shows how ugly and messy an otome game's story can be when events don't conveniently line up for the heroine. Instead of an idealized romance based on the heroine choosing her lover, Dating Sim depicts a total jungle where young men and women alike compete with every dirty trick they know. Mean girls and desperate boys are everywhere, with bullying, verbal/emotional abuse, manipulation, jealousy, unfriendly rivalries and nasty love triangles being the order of the day.  When everyone is fighting over a lover with their futures at stake, these wild students will stop at nothing and more than a few hearts will be broken. Otome games' characters rapidly become miserable when the convenient framework and plot armor of the main storyline fall apart. Characters like Katarina and Leon find themselves in the middle of it all. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate Volume 18 Establishes the Series' First Love Triangle          How Trapped in a Dating Sim's Leon Can Fight For Survival                Some isekai anime are a typical power fantasy where the OP hero can use their overwhelming skills, magic or weapons to defeat their foes and get their way. That is not the case for Trapped in a Dating Sim's Leon, who finds himself in the middle of an otome nightmare.  Final Fantasy combat skills only count for so much in this game, and Leon must become a better-rounded hero to succeed and find a happy ending in a sea of mean girls and tangled personal relationships. He will need to sharpen his soft skills to survive this particular combat system where interpersonal relationships and influence are stronger than any mecha suit, though the odds are stacked against him. RELATED: Ya Boy Kongming! Puts a Unique Twist on Classic Isekai Anime As a background ""mob"" character, Leon faces the worst aspects of an otome game without the benefits of being the heroine -- in this case, Olivia. In fact, Olivia herself seems overwhelmed, and three episodes into the show, she hasn't said or done much to advance her standing at the school. When plot armor and convenient story threads are stripped away, everything becomes an emotionally taxing free-for-all, and it's all Leon can do to survive.  Fortunately he already knows who's who and what's what in this game, which can shore up his weak social standing somewhat and give him an unexpected edge. If he can press that advantage and exploit the rules of this otome jungle, he may thrive after all. Leon must use every last ounce of his wits to beat the mean girls at their own game -- and it should continue to make Trapped in a Dating Sim a good watch.

But as Trapped in a Dating Sim proves, the characters involved are often doomed to misery.                 Trapped in a Dating Sim is a brand new isekai anime title of the Spring 2022 anime season, joining the ranks of video game-based series such as My Next Life as a Villainess and Overlord. Curiously, Dating Sim's underdog protagonist Leon Bartfort finds himself in, of all things, an otome game setting with some Final Fanasy combat elements thrown in.  The series promises some sci-fi/fantasy action in future episodes, but for now its focus remains on the otome game element, where Leon must navigate a female-dominated world where relationships and personal influence mean everything. All this shows how much some gamers underestimate the hidden dark side of otome games in general. RELATED: How Trapped in a Dating Sim Blends Shield Hero With My Next Life as a Villainess          The Dark Side Of Otome Games In Isekai Anime                It is easy for any gamer in real life or an anime series to appreciate the perks of being a video game hero. The story's events will usually unfold favorably and give them a happily-ever-after, since games are a form of escapism where the player is supposed to win after overcoming fun challenges. However, events are not so fun for the side characters, who might end up getting killed or at least have their plans and personal lives derailed. But the player has no reason to care, as long as they get what they want.  Game-based isekai anime such as My Next Life as a Villainess and Trapped in a Dating Sim change all that by thrusting the hapless hero into an otome game world as a side character -- or even as the cruel villainess instead. This forces the heroes to view the game world in a whole new light, and they have little to no plot armor protecting them. In fact, Villainess protagonist Katarina Claes had doom flags bearing down on her -- the inverse of plot armor -- and strove to reinvent everyone's social lives to avert her bad ending.

Space Battleship Yamato is one of the most highly regarded and influential franchises in anime history. Continually building upon its storyline with new twists and turns, not to mention containing very mature themes for its time, the series was instrumental in pushing anime into the medium that it is today. It's also connected, in one way or another, to several other classic anime titles from that time period.  Newer entries in Yamato have been sporadic throughout the decades, with most of them acting as sequels to the original series. More recently, however, the show has been rebooted for a new generation, even bearing a name that Western fans might recognize. Here's a look back at the history of Space Battleship Yamato and how to watch the different versions. RELATED: Future Diary: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          The Plot of Space Battleship Yamato                 Space Battleship Yamato is set in the far-flung future of 2199, and it's a grim set of events indeed. Humanity and planet Earth have been ravaged by the Gamilas aliens, who have bombarded the planet with radiation that threatens to kill them. However, humanity soon receives help from the unlikeliest of sources. A message from the alien queen Starsha informs them that her people can save the Earth from radiation, all while giving the human race the means to get there.  Receiving the blueprints for faster-than-light technology, the people of Earth build the Yamato -- a space-faring craft made from the remains of the WW2 Japanese seacraft of the same name. Making their way into space, they soon discover the truth behind Queen Starsha's people, as well as the true intentions of the Gamilas. The story of Space Battleship Yamato was heavily inspired by stories such as Japan Sinks, Lord of the Flies and The Poseidon Adventure. Themes of humanity triumphing over all adversity in the face of external and self-inflicted problems put it a cut above the typical fare of Japanese cartoons at the time. Thus, the series quickly entered the same pantheon as franchises such as Mobile Suit Gundam and the Macross series of space operas. It also has a tentative ""continuity"" with creator Leiji Matsumoto's other works, such as Galaxy Express 999 and Space Captain Harlock.  RELATED: Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels          Where to Read the Space Battleship Yamato Manga                A manga adaptation of Space Battleship Yamato debuted about a month after the anime. It was written by the show's director Leiji Matsumoto, with Akita Shoten handling the art. Running for roughly half a year, the manga mostly retold and condensed stories from the anime, although the shortened content meant that certain elements were missing. The Yamato manga is available in a series of collections called the Space Battleship Yamato Classic Collection. Physical versions of these volumes can be bought through Amazon, Walmart and other major book retailers. Readers can also purchase cheaper digital versions of the series through Kindle and Comixology.  RELATED: Carole & Tuesday: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Where to Watch the Space Battleship Yamato Anime and Its Remakes                 The original Space Battleship Yamato ran for 26 episodes from 1974 to 1975. Its popularity led to a movie retelling, a sequel to that film and then an official anime series sequel titled Space Battleship Yamato II. The original series would be brought over to the West as Star Blazers, which actually retained many of the original themes and mature elements. The first Yamato would later be remade in 2012 as Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2129, homaging both the Japanese and American titles. There were considerable changes made in updating the classic, but the basic premise is still there. It was followed by the film series Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2202, which was a remake of the second anime series.  The classic Yamato anime are pretty hard to come by, both in streaming form and in terms of physical media. Only low-quality DVDs of the original can be found on Amazon. Thankfully, the remakes are a lot more accessible, making them the best way to enjoy the original story. The DVD and Blu-ray collections for Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato and its sequel are widely available through Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. Both shows can also be streamed through a subscription to the Funimation streaming service and bought digitally per episode or entirely on Amazon Prime Video.

Many genres of anime are action-oriented while others center around romance, but there are also plenty of great music-themed anime. As a medium, anime can provide lovely music but can also visually convey the characters' love of it, inspiring viewers to embrace music and maybe even pick up their own instrument.  Although the following series differ from one another, they all have one detail in common: showcasing the characters' passion for music. Viewers can not only get wrapped up in the story and visuals, but the music as well. Fans will have a hard time figuring out which instrument they want to learn after checking out these three titles.

Euphonium Presents a Full Concert Band Music Experience                 Perhaps the best-known of the three is Kyoto Animation's own Sound! Euphonium. From the studio that brought the world K-ON -- another music-themed anime -- Sound! Euphonium focuses on a high school concert band along with its main four girls: Kumiko, Sapphire, Hazuki and Reina. With so many members, there are lots of instruments to demonstrate and choose from.  Episode 2 finds the girls officially getting to pick out their instruments. Kumiko sticks with the titular euphonium, while Sapphire (also known as Midori) goes with her contrabass (also known as an upright bass). Hazuki, being the newbie, learns the tuba and Reina selects the trumpet. RELATED: What Music-Inspired Anime to Watch After takt op.Destiny Although the main cast of Sound! Euphonium is mostly brass instruments, there is still a wide variety of others seen among the other band members. This can give viewers a great breadth of instruments to experience and get inspired by while the show's intriguing plot focuses on a common high school band problem: whether they want to work hard and aim high to win the National competition, or just goof off and have fun with instruments.  While most people in the band outwardly say they want to work hard and be good, that is not how it always turns out. Just because they want to win the competition doesn't mean they're always willing to put in the work for it. Sound! Euphonium follows this dilemma and explores how students navigate high school band. RELATED: Honeyworks: How to Get Started on the Music-Based Franchise          Kids on the Slope Spotlights Historical Jazz Music                 The next music-inspired anime, Kids on the Slope, is rather less discussed but still impressive in its own right. Although the manga began in 2007 with the anime arriving in 2012, the story itself takes place in 1966 Nagasaki, making this an interesting musical period piece.  Kids on the Slope follows three main characters: Kaoru Nishimi, a wealthy kid who just moved into town and plays classical music on the piano, Sentaro Kawabuchi -- a known delinquent who loves jazz and playing the drums -- and Ritsuko Mukae, Sentaro's childhood friend. Although they get off to a rocky start, the three become great friends and even bandmates as the story goes along. The plot revolves around jazz and how its music affects the trio's lives as they explore and grow in their adolescence. Viewers get to experience the music through two different lenses. One is the experienced lover who has already honed his craft -- Sentaro -- and the other is through the fresh eyes of a person discovering jazz for the first time with Kaoru. With both Kaoru and Sentaro proving to be adept at their instruments, viewers get to readily dive into the good parts of music anime and hear the main characters jam together very early on.  RELATED: Carole & Tuesday: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Given Combines BL Romance With Rock & Roll                Given may be more on the common side as it follows a rock band, but it also stands out from the crowd in that it's a BL (Boys Love) anime. Just because there are heavy romance elements, however, does not mean Given ignores the music. The story follows the main characters and love interests: Mafuyu Satou, a high schooler always clinging to his red Gibson guitar -- even though he doesn't know how to play it -- and Ritsuka Uenoyama, a punk who loves rock music and is in a band. After lots of pleading during a chance encounter on the stairs, Mafuyu would not only convince Ritsuka to fix his guitar, but also teach him how to play it.

25-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.cbr.com/great-musical-anime-inspire-instrument-learning/,Best Musical Anime That Inspire Viewers to Learn an Instrument,"      Home Anime Great Musical Anime That Will Make You Want to Learn an Instrument    Great Musical Anime That Will Make You Want to Learn an Instrument  By CBR Staff Published 16 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The following three music-inspired anime are guaranteed to leave many viewers with the desire to grab an instrument and learn to play for themselves.                 Many genres of anime are action-oriented while others center around romance, but there are also plenty of great music-themed anime. As a medium, anime can provide lovely music but can also visually convey the characters' love of it, inspiring viewers to embrace music and maybe even pick up their own instrument.  Although the following series differ from one another, they all have one detail in common: showcasing the characters' passion for music. Viewers can not only get wrapped up in the story and visuals, but the music as well. Fans will have a hard time figuring out which instrument they want to learn after checking out these three titles. RELATED: Pokémon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media          Sound! Euphonium Presents a Full Concert Band Music Experience                 Perhaps the best-known of the three is Kyoto Animation's own Sound! Euphonium. From the studio that brought the world K-ON -- another music-themed anime -- Sound! Euphonium focuses on a high school concert band along with its main four girls: Kumiko, Sapphire, Hazuki and Reina. With so many members, there are lots of instruments to demonstrate and choose from.  Episode 2 finds the girls officially getting to pick out their instruments. Kumiko sticks with the titular euphonium, while Sapphire (also known as Midori) goes with her contrabass (also known as an upright bass). Hazuki, being the newbie, learns the tuba and Reina selects the trumpet. RELATED: What Music-Inspired Anime to Watch After takt op.Destiny Although the main cast of Sound! Euphonium is mostly brass instruments, there is still a wide variety of others seen among the other band members. This can give viewers a great breadth of instruments to experience and get inspired by while the show's intriguing plot focuses on a common high school band problem: whether they want to work hard and aim high to win the National competition, or just goof off and have fun with instruments.  While most people in the band outwardly say they want to work hard and be good, that is not how it always turns out. Just because they want to win the competition doesn't mean they're always willing to put in the work for it. Sound! Euphonium follows this dilemma and explores how students navigate high school band. RELATED: Honeyworks: How to Get Started on the Music-Based Franchise          Kids on the Slope Spotlights Historical Jazz Music                 The next music-inspired anime, Kids on the Slope, is rather less discussed but still impressive in its own right. Although the manga began in 2007 with the anime arriving in 2012, the story itself takes place in 1966 Nagasaki, making this an interesting musical period piece.  Kids on the Slope follows three main characters: Kaoru Nishimi, a wealthy kid who just moved into town and plays classical music on the piano, Sentaro Kawabuchi -- a known delinquent who loves jazz and playing the drums -- and Ritsuko Mukae, Sentaro's childhood friend. Although they get off to a rocky start, the three become great friends and even bandmates as the story goes along. The plot revolves around jazz and how its music affects the trio's lives as they explore and grow in their adolescence. Viewers get to experience the music through two different lenses. One is the experienced lover who has already honed his craft -- Sentaro -- and the other is through the fresh eyes of a person discovering jazz for the first time with Kaoru. With both Kaoru and Sentaro proving to be adept at their instruments, viewers get to readily dive into the good parts of music anime and hear the main characters jam together very early on.  RELATED: Carole & Tuesday: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Given Combines BL Romance With Rock & Roll                Given may be more on the common side as it follows a rock band, but it also stands out from the crowd in that it's a BL (Boys Love) anime. Just because there are heavy romance elements, however, does not mean Given ignores the music. The story follows the main characters and love interests: Mafuyu Satou, a high schooler always clinging to his red Gibson guitar -- even though he doesn't know how to play it -- and Ritsuka Uenoyama, a punk who loves rock music and is in a band. After lots of pleading during a chance encounter on the stairs, Mafuyu would not only convince Ritsuka to fix his guitar, but also teach him how to play it.  Given then follows the whole band as Mafuyu and Ritsuka grow together, not only as musicians but as teenagers. With one of the main characters being a newbie to music and Ritsuka having to teach him how to play the guitar from the beginning, seeing Mafuyu's progress can inspire any viewer to pick up a guitar and start rocking.

Avatar: The Last Airbender may have centered Aang's battle with Fire Lord Ozai as its central conflict, but over the course of his adventures there were plenty of other villains along the way. Perhaps one of the most menacing was Long Feng, the leader of the Dai Li who utilized his cunning to seize control of the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se for himself.  Long Feng's threat absorbed much the latter half of the series' second season but despite all that focus, fans did not know much about the shadowy leader until now. Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game, the TTRPG from Magpie Games, revealed more about Long Feng's background than ever before in Wan Shi Tong's Adventure Guide. The Last Airbender's mysterious villain is finally beginning to step out of the shadows. RELATED: Avatar: Katara's Necklace Was Season 1's Greatest Plot Point                Initially seeming helpful and even friendly to Aang and his friends upon their arrival in Ba Sing Se, there was much more than met the eye with the city's Grand Secretariat. Long Feng's position granted him control over the Dai Li, the elite earthbending secret police of the city tasked centuries ago by Avatar Kyoshi with preserving the Earth Kingdom's cultural heritage. Under Long Feng's rule, however, it was clear that the mission was perverted into a megalomaniacal quest for power that insulated the Earth King from any true authority.  But very little was ever revealed about Long Feng himself throughout his involvement in Avatar: The Last Airbender. The closest viewers came was when Azula outmaneuvered him for control of the Dai Li, psychologically dissecting him on the spot as she assumed much about Long Feng's background. There, Azula assumed that Long Feng was born with nothing, struggling and conniving for power. Never one to give too much away, he did not bother to confirm her suspicions. RELATED: Avatar: Aang's Flaws Are What Made Him a Great Hero Luckily, Wan Shi Tong's Adventure Guide does. The addition to the Avatar Legends core book provides many details about Long Feng so Game Masters can run him as a Non-Playable Character, and that includes details about his upbringing. The book details how he grew up in Ba Sing Se's Middle Ring, and though he was not born with nothing as Azula suspected, he wasn't exactly wealthy either. Regardless, Long Feng's cunning and intellect -- combined with his immense earthbending talents -- allowed him to rise through the ranks of the Dai Li.  The lattermost detail is perhaps one of the most interesting, as it was not always necessarily clear whether he himself was a member of the Dai Li or if he simply assumed authority over them as a result of his government position. But the details about his background stand out as an awesome and efficient way to understand his character. The rags-to-riches story Azula painted would almost be more mythic, but instead Long Feng's background was extraordinarily ordinary. RELATED: What Will Yangchen's Novel Reveal About the Avatar Before Her?                His confrontation with Azula stands out as all the more scathing in its burn as a result. Azula telling Long Feng that he was never even a player at his own game reverberates with his upbringing amid such mediocrity, and the fact that the Dai Li represented the first circle where he truly felt special makes it all the more painful that Azula stole them away from him.  One last interesting detail on Long Feng's involvement with the Dai Li is that Wan Shi Tong's Adventure Guide makes it clear that the organization was already corrupt by the time he came along. In other words, he wasn't even instrumental in the history of his own enforcers. Until Avatar fans learn more about the rest of Long Feng's history, it seems the true tragedy to his tale is how resoundingly average it has been for the conniving mastermind from start to finish.

However, Episode 2 of Ascendance of a Book Season 3 shows what else is important to her.                  The following contains spoilers for Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3, Episode 2 ""The Story About Winter Stays and the Future,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Ascendance of a Bookworm's lovely protagonist Myne has always been clear about her priorities, continually putting her love of books above all else. However, she also places great importance on other things -- and she reiterates those priorities in Episode 2 of Season 3.  Although Myne can be selfish and narrow-sighted when it comes to books, she protects her loved ones in her own ways. She once re-created shampoo for her and her family's sake, and also made Tuuli a unique hair ornament for her coming-of-age ceremony. Of course, there's also the instance where Myne almost murdered members of the church for threatening her family -- and it happened again in this episode. RELATED:Ya Boy Kongming! Puts a Unique Twist On Classic Isekai Anime                 Due to the bad weather winter brings, Myne was forced to remain in the cathedral for the rest of the season. Her family and colleagues were allowed to visit her occasionally, but that only somewhat alleviated the young girl's homesickness. She could only bury her face in work, creating board games and teaching her servants. While most of her days were generally peaceful, shady characters caught wind of her inventive genius and further measures were required to ensure her safety.  Damuel, one of the knights who failed to keep her safe during the Trombe subjugation, was tasked to be her bodyguard. Ferdinand and Karstedt, however, felt that was still insufficient. Ferdinand suggested that Karstedt adopt Myne, which the young girl vehemently rejected. She hated the idea so much that the mere mention of it triggered her magical ability to activate mana. Ferdinand even had to use magical objects to stabilize her condition. Myne explained to Ferdinand that his peeking into her memories reminded her of the family she could no longer see, so she once again begged him not to take her away from them.  RELATED:Is Doron Dororon Going Too Fast?                 Episode 2 of Ascendance of a Bookworm's third season proves how strong Myne's attachments are to her family, which even the companionship of her servants couldn't supplement. The regrets from her previous life reinforce her need for familial love, and attempts to separate her from them end up being disastrous. Even though Myne managed to push Ferdinand's plan away for the time being, it doesn't remove the dangers targeting her, so she will have to come up with another idea to ensure her safety. In addition, she will eventually have to face the fact that she'll be separated from her family later on. The question now is whether she will be emotionally stable enough by then that her mana won't go berserk.  Myne has shown in previous seasons how much she loves her family and has reaffirmed it again here. Her affection for them  is so strong that the mere thought of being separated from them causes her to go berserk. Although she still probably holds books in the highest regard, Myne almost equally takes care of her family.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Chapter 62.2 by Tatsuya Endo, Casey Loe and Rina Mapa, available in English now via Viz Media.   Twilight gave up his identity and his past life to don a new name and life of multiple identities -- all for the sake of peace between Westalis and Ostania. As shown in last week's Spy x Family, Twilight as a boy was nothing like his adult counterpart: he loved playing soldier and pretending to fight, and constantly butted heads with his father who reprimanded him for wanting a war to happen.  While the era in which Spy x Family is set appears to be during the Cold War, it's not hard to draw parallels between Chapter 62.2 and what is happening between Ukraine and Russia right now. The moment the first bomb was detonated, the trajectory of Twilight's life changed forever. RELATED: Spy x Family Briefly Explores the Gentle Parenting Method                Visually, the scenes of the bomb explosion and the air raid were some of the most harrowing. Twilight gets blasted off his feet after one explodes a few feet away from him, ironically being saved by the helmet he bought with the money he lied to his father for. After the smoke cleared away, there was nothing left except broken pieces of brick and wood, and the sign to indicate that a croquette shop once existed. Twilight and his mother packed up their lives in a single suitcase and moved to Kielberg, but their sense of safety was short-lived. Not too long after, an air raid was launched.  Spy x Family creator Tatsuya Endo conveyed the terror evoked by an air raid in just two spreads. The first is messy and cluttered, with everyone panicking and scrambling to get to the shelter. In the ensuing confusion, Twilight gets ushered into darkness, surrounded by screams and the bombs exploding. He bursts out of the shelter to look for his mother and the page is filled with him shouting for her. Instead of the usual smooth lines, the lines of these panels are jagged as if the screams and explosions are breaking the page up. The second spread is completely blank except for a few tiny pieces of debris floating in the air, showing the aftermath of the air raid. Readers don't get to see what happened to Twilight's mother, father or his friends, which is even more terrifying than seeing their bodies. The sparse artwork sends a powerful message on the impact of war, felt even more acutely as these scenes parallel the air strikes in Ukraine.  RELATED: Spy x Family’s Anya Is the Perfect Matchmaker                 To process what had happened, Twilight recalls all the lies he'd previously heard. The grown-ups had told him Westalis and Ostania would become friends. In fact, his own father had told him there would be no war. There's a surprising parallel between Twilight and Anya during this scene. Both of them have voiced that ""grown-ups are liars"" but the context in which the words are said is vastly different. Because she's able to read minds, Anya knows for a sure fact that the adults around her are lying. But Twilight only learns they were lying after seeing those lies, quite literally, blow up in front of his face.  There's something quietly tragic about Twilight admitting he was a liar too. The lie he told to get ten dalc -- and even the lies Anya told -- are innocent in nature and don't have the same impact compared to those of the adults. Chapter 62.2 of Spy x Family is even more hard-hitting -- readers witness Twilight being forced to grow up, right at the moment when he said his father had broken his promise to take his son to the town fair. RELATED: How Spy x Family & Kotaro Lives Alone Change Up Anime's Found Family Trope Twilight lost everything that day: his family, friends, and his trust. Lies that used to cause a pit to grow in his stomach and make him feel insurmountably guilty are now delivered without even blinking. His father hadn't wanted him to fight in the war but with the state of the world as it was, did Twilight even have a choice?  Young Twilight wondered ""how many tens of thousands of corpses had to pile up before [he'd] finally see the light of dawn on the horizon,"" believing violence was the answer. While he still employs violence in his current job as a spy, his thinking has shifted and is more hopeful. Before, he wasn't sure what he was even fighting for; now he has something tangible to protect.

Watching anime can provide some educational benefits surrounding Japanese culture and beliefs for foreign fans, even if offers only a glimpse into Japanese daily life. In recent years, more and more edutainment anime have also seen relative success, with series like Cells at Work becoming popular. One series has expanded on this idea, walking viewers through various aspects of Japanese life, such as teaching viewers how to prepare for the Japanese New Year to cleaning special items like tatami mats. That series is Shibawanko no Wa no Kokoro.  Originally a series of children's books, the 2006 anime focuses on a Shiba Inu and a calico cat as they learn about and explore Japanese culture. They live together in a traditional Japanese home and can speak to humans. Shibawanko the dog does the cleaning, laundry and cooking, while Mikenyanko the cat isn't so good with chores. Each episode is short -- only about two minutes in length -- with 80 episodes making up the entire series. The style resembles that of a picture book, with live-action shots mixed in to show what certain actions actually look like. RELATED: How Aharen-San Is Indecipherable Makes Great Use of Visual Comedy                  Written by Yoshie Kawaura and published in 2002, the books were targeted at children, who begin helping with household chores at a young age in Japan. The books focused on teaching children how to properly live in Wa, the Japanese-style spirit. Each chapter focused on a new lesson, ranging from how to be a good host for house guests to how to wear kimono to celebrating the Autumn Moon. One lesson focuses on how to politely open a traditional fusuma sliding door, first by kneeling in front of the door and using the handle to gently slide it open with one's right hand only about five centimeters. Continuing to use the right hand, one slides the door open a little more from the middle of the edge, then switches to the left hand once the frame of the door is perpendicular to the left side of the body. Finally, the door is opened enough for the guest to enter -- roughly 30 centimeters. If the door slides open from left to right, the movements would be the opposite, beginning with the left hand and ending with the right.  RELATED: Heroines Run the Show Takes Idol Anime in a New Direction                  Many anime depict Japan as a modern country with advanced technology, and while this is true to a point, tradition is still alive and well. Many women still wear kimono as casual clothing rather than just ceremonial attire or something to wear to a summer festival. Japanese neighborhoods feature traditionally-styled homes next to newer designs, and there are a certain set of standards one is expected to adhere to in society, manners being some of the most important aspects. Even some modern apartments include tatami rooms in larger-scale units, although this isn't a standard inclusion. Knowing how to properly maintain the straw flooring is important because it can easily mold if the wrong cleaner is used.  By creating a children's series based on traditional ideas, Kawaura was not only educating children on how people used to do things but also keeping those traditions alive. It's easy to look toward the future and create new ways of living, but sometimes it's nice to slow down and enjoy the way things used to be as well. Modern conveniences are wonderful, but knowing how to live traditionally creates a deeper connection to one's culture and keeps the spirit of that culture alive. There can be a balance between the old and the new.

25-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.cbr.com/shibawanko-no-wa-no-kokoro-educational-anime-japanese-culture/,Shibawanko no Wa no Kokoro Teaches About Japanese Culture,"      Home Anime Shibawanko no Wa no Kokoro Is the Ultimate Edutainment Anime    Shibawanko no Wa no Kokoro Is the Ultimate Edutainment Anime  By Molly Kishikawa Published 21 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The series follows a cat and a dog as they explore traditional Japanese life and culture.                 Watching anime can provide some educational benefits surrounding Japanese culture and beliefs for foreign fans, even if offers only a glimpse into Japanese daily life. In recent years, more and more edutainment anime have also seen relative success, with series like Cells at Work becoming popular. One series has expanded on this idea, walking viewers through various aspects of Japanese life, such as teaching viewers how to prepare for the Japanese New Year to cleaning special items like tatami mats. That series is Shibawanko no Wa no Kokoro.  Originally a series of children's books, the 2006 anime focuses on a Shiba Inu and a calico cat as they learn about and explore Japanese culture. They live together in a traditional Japanese home and can speak to humans. Shibawanko the dog does the cleaning, laundry and cooking, while Mikenyanko the cat isn't so good with chores. Each episode is short -- only about two minutes in length -- with 80 episodes making up the entire series. The style resembles that of a picture book, with live-action shots mixed in to show what certain actions actually look like. RELATED: How Aharen-San Is Indecipherable Makes Great Use of Visual Comedy                  Written by Yoshie Kawaura and published in 2002, the books were targeted at children, who begin helping with household chores at a young age in Japan. The books focused on teaching children how to properly live in Wa, the Japanese-style spirit. Each chapter focused on a new lesson, ranging from how to be a good host for house guests to how to wear kimono to celebrating the Autumn Moon. One lesson focuses on how to politely open a traditional fusuma sliding door, first by kneeling in front of the door and using the handle to gently slide it open with one's right hand only about five centimeters. Continuing to use the right hand, one slides the door open a little more from the middle of the edge, then switches to the left hand once the frame of the door is perpendicular to the left side of the body. Finally, the door is opened enough for the guest to enter -- roughly 30 centimeters. If the door slides open from left to right, the movements would be the opposite, beginning with the left hand and ending with the right.  RELATED: Heroines Run the Show Takes Idol Anime in a New Direction                  Many anime depict Japan as a modern country with advanced technology, and while this is true to a point, tradition is still alive and well. Many women still wear kimono as casual clothing rather than just ceremonial attire or something to wear to a summer festival. Japanese neighborhoods feature traditionally-styled homes next to newer designs, and there are a certain set of standards one is expected to adhere to in society, manners being some of the most important aspects. Even some modern apartments include tatami rooms in larger-scale units, although this isn't a standard inclusion. Knowing how to properly maintain the straw flooring is important because it can easily mold if the wrong cleaner is used.  By creating a children's series based on traditional ideas, Kawaura was not only educating children on how people used to do things but also keeping those traditions alive. It's easy to look toward the future and create new ways of living, but sometimes it's nice to slow down and enjoy the way things used to be as well. Modern conveniences are wonderful, but knowing how to live traditionally creates a deeper connection to one's culture and keeps the spirit of that culture alive. There can be a balance between the old and the new.

The following contains spoilers for Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3, Episode 2 ""The Story About Winter Stays and the Future,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Being sent to a world where books are only accessible to nobles, Myne sets out to revolutionize Ascendance of a Bookworm's society by re-creating inventions from her previous life. She not only figured out a way to create paper, ink and eventually books during the first two seasons, but she also brought new food recipes and products that improve quality of life. Despite her obvious genius, the people close to her can't seem to consider her an equal -- and it is once again causing them problems.  Myne's body isn't in the best condition, and her physical weakness greatly limits her activities. As such, she depends on others most of the time. She is fortunate to be blessed with family and friends who are always willing to extend a helping hand. Even the ones she meets later on, Ferdinand and Benno, seem to be prioritizing her well-being at all times. RELATED:The Most Anticipated New & Returning Isekai Anime of Spring 2022                 Since winter had already come in Ascendance of a Bookworm, Myne could no longer stay with her parents, but her family and friends were given permission to visit her in the cathedral. While the little girl remained safe within the confines of the church, shady entities were already targeting her and her knowledge.  The Ink Guild master known as Wolf had his eyes on Myne after discovering her new ink, and he was renowned for using any means necessary to accomplish his goals. Catching wind of this development, Benno went to the Cathedral to present Myne's new robes and discuss the child's current predicament with both her and Ferdinand. When Benno left, Ferdinand and Karstedt, the commander of the Knight's Order, discussed the safety measures that must be enforced to ensure Myne's welfare. Ferdinand suggested that Karstedt adopt her, establishing her status as a noble. However, Myne wasn't fond of the idea as she didn't want to be separated from her family. The mere mention of it resulted in her mana acting wildly -- so much so that Ferdinand had to use a magic object just to stabilize her condition.  RELATED:What Makes Older Isekai Anime More Unique Than Their Modern Counterparts                 Although they were putting Myne's welfare as the highest priority, Ferdinand and the other adults treating her as a child is unacceptable, and they are now facing the consequences. Myne's outburst could have been easily avoided had Ferdinand first consulted her about her future, especially since he's already been made aware of her circumstances. It is not the first time Myne has lost control of her mana when it comes to her loved ones and is unlikely to be the last. Ferdinand is aware of this since he's also the one who stopped Myne from murdering the bishop.  Even disregarding the destabilization of Myne's mana and emotion, Ferdinand comes off as tyrannical for making important decisions regarding Myne's future. He independently decided to set her up for adoption and only told her about it after discussing it with Karstedt. If not for Myne going berserk, Ferdinand might have forced his plan into action. Ferdinand's character may generally be presented as good or kind, but he exhibits rather questionable behaviors. He not only intruded on Myne's memory with questionable consent, but he also tried to dictate her future. Given that a greater danger is threatening Myne's wellbeing, viewers of Ascendance of a Bookworm may finally be seeing its protagonist stand up for herself.                   Ya Boy Kongming!

25-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-season-3-episode-2-spoilers-myne-treatment-problematic/,Ascendance of a Bookworm's Cast Continues Its Biggest Mistake With Myne,"      Home Anime Ascendance of a Bookworm: Myne Being Treated Like a Child Remains Problematic    Ascendance of a Bookworm: Myne Being Treated Like a Child Remains Problematic  By Christian Markle Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Myne is fortunate to be surrounded by people who truly care for her, though as Season 3 Episode 2 reveals, some still show it in problematic ways.                  The following contains spoilers for Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3, Episode 2 ""The Story About Winter Stays and the Future,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Being sent to a world where books are only accessible to nobles, Myne sets out to revolutionize Ascendance of a Bookworm's society by re-creating inventions from her previous life. She not only figured out a way to create paper, ink and eventually books during the first two seasons, but she also brought new food recipes and products that improve quality of life. Despite her obvious genius, the people close to her can't seem to consider her an equal -- and it is once again causing them problems.  Myne's body isn't in the best condition, and her physical weakness greatly limits her activities. As such, she depends on others most of the time. She is fortunate to be blessed with family and friends who are always willing to extend a helping hand. Even the ones she meets later on, Ferdinand and Benno, seem to be prioritizing her well-being at all times. RELATED:The Most Anticipated New & Returning Isekai Anime of Spring 2022                 Since winter had already come in Ascendance of a Bookworm, Myne could no longer stay with her parents, but her family and friends were given permission to visit her in the cathedral. While the little girl remained safe within the confines of the church, shady entities were already targeting her and her knowledge.  The Ink Guild master known as Wolf had his eyes on Myne after discovering her new ink, and he was renowned for using any means necessary to accomplish his goals. Catching wind of this development, Benno went to the Cathedral to present Myne's new robes and discuss the child's current predicament with both her and Ferdinand. When Benno left, Ferdinand and Karstedt, the commander of the Knight's Order, discussed the safety measures that must be enforced to ensure Myne's welfare. Ferdinand suggested that Karstedt adopt her, establishing her status as a noble. However, Myne wasn't fond of the idea as she didn't want to be separated from her family. The mere mention of it resulted in her mana acting wildly -- so much so that Ferdinand had to use a magic object just to stabilize her condition.  RELATED:What Makes Older Isekai Anime More Unique Than Their Modern Counterparts                 Although they were putting Myne's welfare as the highest priority, Ferdinand and the other adults treating her as a child is unacceptable, and they are now facing the consequences. Myne's outburst could have been easily avoided had Ferdinand first consulted her about her future, especially since he's already been made aware of her circumstances. It is not the first time Myne has lost control of her mana when it comes to her loved ones and is unlikely to be the last. Ferdinand is aware of this since he's also the one who stopped Myne from murdering the bishop.  Even disregarding the destabilization of Myne's mana and emotion, Ferdinand comes off as tyrannical for making important decisions regarding Myne's future. He independently decided to set her up for adoption and only told her about it after discussing it with Karstedt. If not for Myne going berserk, Ferdinand might have forced his plan into action. Ferdinand's character may generally be presented as good or kind, but he exhibits rather questionable behaviors. He not only intruded on Myne's memory with questionable consent, but he also tried to dictate her future. Given that a greater danger is threatening Myne's wellbeing, viewers of Ascendance of a Bookworm may finally be seeing its protagonist stand up for herself.                   Ya Boy Kongming!

Here are some examples.                 Most protagonists in anime are young adolescents, standing at the cusp between childhood and adulthood. But there are quite a few that are older than the norm, old enough even to have at least one child. Many main characters already have a tough enough time getting through the daily grind of saving the world or training for sports competitions, so imagine having to raise a child and maintain a household on top of all that?  While rare, a few shows put the spotlight on those types of characters. These protagonists are not young or fresh, nor are they trying to avenge their parents or go on a world-saving quest. These shows follow protagonists as they try (and sometimes fail) to balance their work-life and home-life. RELATED: Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness Promises the Sweetest Slice-of-Life in Years          Kakushigoto is a Slice-of-Life Comedy With an Underlying Mystery                Kakushigoto is a slice-of-life comedy about Kakushi Goto, a semi-popular manga artist that loves his work but takes no pride in what he creates. Most of the plot revolves around the ridiculous lengths he's willing to go through to ensure that his daughter, HIme, never finds out about his occupation. However, in between all of Kakushi's silly shenanigans are occasional glimpses of the future narrated by an older Hime. Her father is never seen, and it’s heavily implied that something has happened to him. As to what that something is, the viewer will have to stick around to find out.          Tiger & Bunny Shows How Superheroing Makes Parenting More Difficult                Tiger & Bunny is an action superhero show about a middle-aged man that's doing his best to remain relevant to the current generation of fans and young heroes. But in addition to being a superhero within the public eye, Kotetsu must also find the time to raise his young daughter amidst his ever-busy schedule. During these brief glimpses of his personal life, the viewer is reminded that underneath the sponsor-branded armor, Kotetsu is still very human and must deal with the same struggles that most men his age contend with on a daily basis: being a good dad.  RELATED: Pokémon: Who Are Misty's Parents – and Why Haven't We Seen Them?          Maquia is a Heartwarming Film About a Mother's Selfless Love                Maquia is the heartwarming tale of the struggles that come with being a single mother raising a young child during wartime, with the added twist of a fantasy backdrop. The story follows the titular Maquia's struggles to raise her adopted son from infancy to adolescence with the added pressure of hiding her race (a long-lived one, not unlike elves) from other humans. Despite mother and child not being related by blood, they form a genuinely strong bond that persists throughout the film's entirety. But be warned, this one’s a tear-jerker, so have a tissue box at the ready.          The Gymnastics Samurai is a Sports Anime About a Single Dad                The Gymnastics Samurai is a sports anime that follows Jotaro Aragaki, a middle-aged gymnast and former Olympian that has been in the game for several years now. After receiving an injury on his shoulder, his coach recommends that he finally retire from the sport and allow the newer, younger generation to take the stage. Jotaro ultimately refuses to give up the sport, and with the support of his precocious daughter, he perseveres. It's an inspiring sports story that encourages viewers to pursue their dreams regardless of how old they are, so long as they have the passion for it.          Sweetness and Lighting is a Delectable Series About Cooking and Family                 Sweetness and Lightning is about Kouhei Inuzuka, a high school teacher and a recent widower that's still in mourning over the loss of his wife. After realizing that his daughter is the only child at her school that always eats store-bought food, he decides to take it upon himself to learn how to cook for her. Enlisting the help of one of his students, Kouhei slowly starts to discover the joys of cooking. Filled with lovingly drawn food and a wholesome father-daughter relationship that's central to the show's plot, this series is equal parts cute and sweet, just as its title suggests.

By Magnus Carlstrom Published 15 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   There is still one Road Poneglyph unaccounted for in One Piece, so who took it? Are where have they been hiding it?                 The world of One Piece features four Road Poneglyphs. Each one reveals a coordinate that, when combined with the others, reveals the location of Laugh Tale, the island that supposedly holds the One Piece treasure. The location of each Road Poneglyph was discovered by Gol. D. Roger and his crew over 20 years ago -- but now one seems to be missing.  In Oden's flashback, the Roger Pirates find the various Road Poneglyphs with relative ease. They already had a head start from the one Big Mom possessed, the Minks and Oden revealed the ones on Zou and Wano, and the other was discovered on Fish-Man Island. The Straw Hats have now visited all these locations, but the one in Fish-Man Island has mysteriously disappeared since the Roger Pirates came. Who could have moved it, and where did they move it to? RELATED: One Piece: Where Is Kaido's Road Poneglyph?                The first possibility is Whitebeard. Following Roger's death, Edward Newgate became the protector of Fish-Man Island and claimed it as his territory to prevent attacks from pirates. He was also one of the few who knew the importance of the Road Poneglyph. Even the mighty name of Whitebeard might not have been enough to scare off pirates looking to find Laugh Tale. It's possible he moved the red stone, knowing pirate groups would turn the Island into a battlefield looking for it.  Whitebeard had a powerful crew behind him and many other islands under his protection, so where could he have hidden the Road Poneglyph? The three islands confirmed to be protected by him were Fish-Man Island, a small tribal island called Foodvalten, and Whitebeard's home of Sphinx. The most likely of these options is Sphinx, which remains under the protection of the remnants of Whitebeard's crew like Marco the Pheonix -- and it's not affliated with the World Government because of its inability to pay the Heavenly Tribute to the Celestial Dragons. This would make Sphinx perfect location to hide the Road Poneglyph. Pirates are unlikely to attack, and if they do, the former Whitebeard Pirates have made it their top priority to protect their late father's home -- and the Navy is unlikely visit an island outside its jurisdiction.  RELATED: One Piece Chapter 1046 Recap and Spoilers: Raizo                 Whitebeard, however, isn't the only person in One Piece who could have hidden the Road Poneglyph. Knowing the true history of the world and that Joy Boy was going to arrive in the near future, it's possible that one of the Roger Pirates moved it. Maybe they wanted to keep other pirates or even the World Government away from it, seeing as it was fairly easy to access in Fish-Man Island. If they were the ones who hid it, there are a few possible locations. Lodestar Island, the last island before Laugh Tale, is an option seeing as the Roger Pirates were more than likely the first people to reach the location in years. There's likewise little known about the next choice, God Valley, which has been completely wiped from the World Map after an incident 38 years ago. Since the Roger Pirates have been there before, they could easily get back regardless of it not being on any newer maps -- unless the island itself was wiped out.  RELATED: One Piece Gives Several Fan-Favorite Characters Bold New Looks                The only problem with the Roger Pirates being the ones who moved the Road Poneglyph is that they immediately ended their adventure after Roger disbanded the crew. Oden was dropped off at Wano, Roger left to see Whitebeard one last time, and seeing as Rayleigh has been on the Sabaody Archipelago for some time, it's likely the crew simply went home one by one. Unless it was their last mission on the way back to the first half of the Grand Line, it's hard to see the crew going to Fish-Man Island -- then going back to the New World before returning once again.  The only former Roger Pirate who could have taken it would be Shanks. The Emperor of the Sea was in the East Blue 12 years before the present-day One Piece began. He and his crew could have taken the stone while heading to the New World. Shanks having possession of it would fall in line with the fact that most of the Emperors had their own Road Poneglyph. RELATED: One Piece Debuts Fresh Art for Shanks And Film: Red’s New Characters Though he was not a Yonko until around six years ago and never reached Laugh Tale himself, Shanks still knew about the importance of the Road Poneglyphs and could have moved the stone to protect it for a certain pirate. Maybe once Luffy has finally reached him as a ""great pirate"" like he asked, Shanks will give him the final Road Poneglyph.  Regardless of who has the final Road Poneglyph in One Piece, it's sure to show up soon. With the ""Wano"" arc coming to an end, the One Piece treasure is closer than ever -- and the Straw Hats will need to find the last one to finally reach Laugh Tale. The next chapter of One Piece will be available on Sunday, April 24th.

One Piece: Who Took the Final Road Poneglyph - and Where Are They Hiding It?  By Magnus Carlstrom Published 15 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   There is still one Road Poneglyph unaccounted for in One Piece, so who took it? Are where have they been hiding it?                 The world of One Piece features four Road Poneglyphs. Each one reveals a coordinate that, when combined with the others, reveals the location of Laugh Tale, the island that supposedly holds the One Piece treasure. The location of each Road Poneglyph was discovered by Gol. D. Roger and his crew over 20 years ago -- but now one seems to be missing.  In Oden's flashback, the Roger Pirates find the various Road Poneglyphs with relative ease. They already had a head start from the one Big Mom possessed, the Minks and Oden revealed the ones on Zou and Wano, and the other was discovered on Fish-Man Island. The Straw Hats have now visited all these locations, but the one in Fish-Man Island has mysteriously disappeared since the Roger Pirates came. Who could have moved it, and where did they move it to? RELATED: One Piece: Where Is Kaido's Road Poneglyph?                The first possibility is Whitebeard. Following Roger's death, Edward Newgate became the protector of Fish-Man Island and claimed it as his territory to prevent attacks from pirates. He was also one of the few who knew the importance of the Road Poneglyph. Even the mighty name of Whitebeard might not have been enough to scare off pirates looking to find Laugh Tale. It's possible he moved the red stone, knowing pirate groups would turn the Island into a battlefield looking for it.  Whitebeard had a powerful crew behind him and many other islands under his protection, so where could he have hidden the Road Poneglyph? The three islands confirmed to be protected by him were Fish-Man Island, a small tribal island called Foodvalten, and Whitebeard's home of Sphinx. The most likely of these options is Sphinx, which remains under the protection of the remnants of Whitebeard's crew like Marco the Pheonix -- and it's not affliated with the World Government because of its inability to pay the Heavenly Tribute to the Celestial Dragons. This would make Sphinx perfect location to hide the Road Poneglyph. Pirates are unlikely to attack, and if they do, the former Whitebeard Pirates have made it their top priority to protect their late father's home -- and the Navy is unlikely visit an island outside its jurisdiction.  RELATED: One Piece Chapter 1046 Recap and Spoilers: Raizo                 Whitebeard, however, isn't the only person in One Piece who could have hidden the Road Poneglyph. Knowing the true history of the world and that Joy Boy was going to arrive in the near future, it's possible that one of the Roger Pirates moved it. Maybe they wanted to keep other pirates or even the World Government away from it, seeing as it was fairly easy to access in Fish-Man Island. If they were the ones who hid it, there are a few possible locations. Lodestar Island, the last island before Laugh Tale, is an option seeing as the Roger Pirates were more than likely the first people to reach the location in years. There's likewise little known about the next choice, God Valley, which has been completely wiped from the World Map after an incident 38 years ago. Since the Roger Pirates have been there before, they could easily get back regardless of it not being on any newer maps -- unless the island itself was wiped out.  RELATED: One Piece Gives Several Fan-Favorite Characters Bold New Looks                The only problem with the Roger Pirates being the ones who moved the Road Poneglyph is that they immediately ended their adventure after Roger disbanded the crew. Oden was dropped off at Wano, Roger left to see Whitebeard one last time, and seeing as Rayleigh has been on the Sabaody Archipelago for some time, it's likely the crew simply went home one by one. Unless it was their last mission on the way back to the first half of the Grand Line, it's hard to see the crew going to Fish-Man Island -- then going back to the New World before returning once again.  The only former Roger Pirate who could have taken it would be Shanks. The Emperor of the Sea was in the East Blue 12 years before the present-day One Piece began. He and his crew could have taken the stone while heading to the New World. Shanks having possession of it would fall in line with the fact that most of the Emperors had their own Road Poneglyph. RELATED: One Piece Debuts Fresh Art for Shanks And Film: Red’s New Characters Though he was not a Yonko until around six years ago and never reached Laugh Tale himself, Shanks still knew about the importance of the Road Poneglyphs and could have moved the stone to protect it for a certain pirate. Maybe once Luffy has finally reached him as a ""great pirate"" like he asked, Shanks will give him the final Road Poneglyph.  Regardless of who has the final Road Poneglyph in One Piece, it's sure to show up soon. With the ""Wano"" arc coming to an end, the One Piece treasure is closer than ever -- and the Straw Hats will need to find the last one to finally reach Laugh Tale. The next chapter of One Piece will be available on Sunday, April 24th.

Despite playing in only a small number of theaters in Japan, ODDTAXI: In the Woods is pulling in major box office numbers.  According to Mantan Web, the compilation film, which does include new animation, has earned approximately $1.03 million (¥130 million) after four weeks. ""Due to the huge success of the film, the number of screening locations will gradually increase from the latter half of April, so we hope you will wait for the information on the release of the film,"" ODDTAXI producer Daisuke Hiraga said. RELATED: One Piece Film: Red's Latest Trailer Reveals the Mystery Girl's Name and More He continued, ""When I think back to the beginning of the project, the fact that it became a film is unbelievable. I think this scale of theater is an objectively accepted level for this film, so I am very happy that so many people have come to see [ODDTAXI: In the Woods] and that it has exceeded the expectations set for it.""  This isn't the first time ODDTAXI and its fans have exceeded the creators' expectations. Despite the immense popularity of the anime series, there was initial hesitation in giving it a Blu-ray release. To gauge interest, the ODDTAXI producers launched a pre-order campaign towards the end of last year: If a minimum of 300 sets were ordered, then the ODDTAXI anime would receive its home-video release. By the end of the campaign, over 6,000 Blu-rays had been pre-ordered. RELATED: Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 Movie Drops New Trailer for Netflix Debut Both the ODDTAXI anime series and ODDTAXI: In the Woods are set in a world of anthropomorphic animals and follow Odokawa, a middle-aged walrus and taxi driver. Produced by OLM and P.I.C.S., the anime series was the industry debut for director Baku Kinoshita and screenwriter Kadzuya Konomoto, who both returned to create ODDTAXI: In the Woods. The main members of the anime's voice cast, including Natsuki Hanae (Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba) and Ryōhei Kimura (Boruto: Naruto Next Generations), returned as well, reprising their roles for the compilation film.  ODDTAXI: In the Woods' impressive box office performance follows similar success stories, including those of Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Evangelion 3.0 + 1.01: Thrice Upon A Time, which were Japan's highest-grossing films in 2021, seemingly showcasing the increasing popularity of anime films as a genre. Crunchyroll has acquired the North American distribution rights for ODDTAXI: In the Woods but, as of writing, an official premiere date has not yet been announced by the streaming service. All thirteen episodes of the ODDTAXI anime series are available on Crunchyroll.

Despite playing in only a small number of theaters in Japan, ODDTAXI: In the Woods is pulling in major box office numbers.  According to Mantan Web, the compilation film, which does include new animation, has earned approximately $1.03 million (¥130 million) after four weeks. ""Due to the huge success of the film, the number of screening locations will gradually increase from the latter half of April, so we hope you will wait for the information on the release of the film,"" ODDTAXI producer Daisuke Hiraga said. RELATED: One Piece Film: Red's Latest Trailer Reveals the Mystery Girl's Name and More He continued, ""When I think back to the beginning of the project, the fact that it became a film is unbelievable. I think this scale of theater is an objectively accepted level for this film, so I am very happy that so many people have come to see [ODDTAXI: In the Woods] and that it has exceeded the expectations set for it.""  This isn't the first time ODDTAXI and its fans have exceeded the creators' expectations. Despite the immense popularity of the anime series, there was initial hesitation in giving it a Blu-ray release. To gauge interest, the ODDTAXI producers launched a pre-order campaign towards the end of last year: If a minimum of 300 sets were ordered, then the ODDTAXI anime would receive its home-video release. By the end of the campaign, over 6,000 Blu-rays had been pre-ordered. RELATED: Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 Movie Drops New Trailer for Netflix Debut Both the ODDTAXI anime series and ODDTAXI: In the Woods are set in a world of anthropomorphic animals and follow Odokawa, a middle-aged walrus and taxi driver. Produced by OLM and P.I.C.S., the anime series was the industry debut for director Baku Kinoshita and screenwriter Kadzuya Konomoto, who both returned to create ODDTAXI: In the Woods. The main members of the anime's voice cast, including Natsuki Hanae (Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba) and Ryōhei Kimura (Boruto: Naruto Next Generations), returned as well, reprising their roles for the compilation film.  ODDTAXI: In the Woods' impressive box office performance follows similar success stories, including those of Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Evangelion 3.0 + 1.01: Thrice Upon A Time, which were Japan's highest-grossing films in 2021, seemingly showcasing the increasing popularity of anime films as a genre. Crunchyroll has acquired the North American distribution rights for ODDTAXI: In the Woods but, as of writing, an official premiere date has not yet been announced by the streaming service. All thirteen episodes of the ODDTAXI anime series are available on Crunchyroll.

By Ciaran McGhee Published 13 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Shikimori may not just be cute and she may not just be cool. But does she qualify as a tsundere, one of anime's most iconic character archetypes?                  The following contains minor spoilers for Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1 and 2, now streaming on Crunchyroll.   A new spring 2022 rom-com anime, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is about the relationship between the cosmically unlucky Izumi and his girlfriend Shikimori. What makes the titular lead unique in her genre is that she often comes across as more cool than cute, more awesome than adorable. Shikimori's stoic protectiveness of Izumi makes her more like the protagonist of an action thriller than a high school romantic comedy. Even so, there are certain classic rom-com tropes that might apply to the unusual heroine.  The term ""tsundere"" essentially describes a character who starts off aloof or aggressive but reveals a warmer side to their personality over time. However, it can also be used to describe characters who change back and forth rapidly between being aggressive and being affectionate. Given Shikimori's often-changing personality, it makes sense for fans to wonder if she counts as a tsundere. Here are some ways in which the term may or may not be applicable to her. RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                 Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie's lead has two distinct sides to her personality -- whereas tsundere characters can be both harsh and kind, Shikimori can be both ""cool"" and ""cute."" Like a typical tsundere character, one side is more friendly and positive while the other is more intense and aggressive-seeming. In Episode 1, Shikimori pouted when Izumi mentioned that she is sometimes ""not cute,"" then revealed that Shikimori's cool side is one of the things he loves about her. He encouraged her to beat his poor score when they went bowling together, and said ""I'm in love"" when she kicked away a signpost that almost fell on him.  In contrast, there are a few ways in which Shikimori's unique personality does not fit the tsundere trope. The stereotype of a tsundere in a romance story is that they either initially dislike another character and warm to them over time, or already have a crush on them but are embarrassed about their own feelings. Both of these scenarios can create romantic drama. However, Shikimori never hides her romantic feelings for Izumi. She is always affectionate toward Izumi, even in her ""cool"" mode. The first appearance of Shikimori's cool side had her protect Izumi from a passing truck's fumes and tell him with a smile, ""I swear... you gotta stop worrying me so much."" Even when she hid her enthusiasm about being in the same class as him again, it was because she was embarrassed about how excited she was, not about how much she likes Izumi. In this way, it could be said that Shikimori and Izumi's relationship is refreshingly secure compared to a more melodramatic tsundere romance.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Echoes 2020's Most Wholesome Rom-Com                  Shikimori sometimes expresses frustration toward Izumi, but even this is mainly because she wants to spend more time with him -- she doesn't pretend to like him less than she does. In Episode 2, she accused him of spending more time with his friend Inuzuka than with herself. She did this with intensity and conviction, but not so much that it was as if her personality had changed. Being calm sometimes and jealous and angry at other times doesn't necessarily make Shikimori a tsundere, it simply makes her human.  She may not be aggressive toward her romantic interest like a stereotypical tsundere, but she has shown the potential to be aggressive toward other characters. In Episode 1, Shikimori overheard a group of boys implying to Izumi that she was too good for him, much to her dismay. A sharp stare from her cool side was enough for the boys to collectively scream in fear, jumping when she slammed the door on them. When Shikimori was seemingly jealous of Inuzuka protecting Izumi from an errant volleyball in Episode 2, another intense stare left Inuzuka in a similar state of fear. Shikimori is clearly capable of both fury and fondness, but doesn't gradually move from one to the other in the story or oscillate unpredictably between the two. It seems clear from the Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie's first two episodes that the tsundere appellation doesn't fit her especially well.

Shikimori’s Not Just a Cutie: Is Shikimori a Tsundere?  By Ciaran McGhee Published 13 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Shikimori may not just be cute and she may not just be cool. But does she qualify as a tsundere, one of anime's most iconic character archetypes?                  The following contains minor spoilers for Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1 and 2, now streaming on Crunchyroll.   A new spring 2022 rom-com anime, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is about the relationship between the cosmically unlucky Izumi and his girlfriend Shikimori. What makes the titular lead unique in her genre is that she often comes across as more cool than cute, more awesome than adorable. Shikimori's stoic protectiveness of Izumi makes her more like the protagonist of an action thriller than a high school romantic comedy. Even so, there are certain classic rom-com tropes that might apply to the unusual heroine.  The term ""tsundere"" essentially describes a character who starts off aloof or aggressive but reveals a warmer side to their personality over time. However, it can also be used to describe characters who change back and forth rapidly between being aggressive and being affectionate. Given Shikimori's often-changing personality, it makes sense for fans to wonder if she counts as a tsundere. Here are some ways in which the term may or may not be applicable to her. RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                 Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie's lead has two distinct sides to her personality -- whereas tsundere characters can be both harsh and kind, Shikimori can be both ""cool"" and ""cute."" Like a typical tsundere character, one side is more friendly and positive while the other is more intense and aggressive-seeming. In Episode 1, Shikimori pouted when Izumi mentioned that she is sometimes ""not cute,"" then revealed that Shikimori's cool side is one of the things he loves about her. He encouraged her to beat his poor score when they went bowling together, and said ""I'm in love"" when she kicked away a signpost that almost fell on him.  In contrast, there are a few ways in which Shikimori's unique personality does not fit the tsundere trope. The stereotype of a tsundere in a romance story is that they either initially dislike another character and warm to them over time, or already have a crush on them but are embarrassed about their own feelings. Both of these scenarios can create romantic drama. However, Shikimori never hides her romantic feelings for Izumi. She is always affectionate toward Izumi, even in her ""cool"" mode. The first appearance of Shikimori's cool side had her protect Izumi from a passing truck's fumes and tell him with a smile, ""I swear... you gotta stop worrying me so much."" Even when she hid her enthusiasm about being in the same class as him again, it was because she was embarrassed about how excited she was, not about how much she likes Izumi. In this way, it could be said that Shikimori and Izumi's relationship is refreshingly secure compared to a more melodramatic tsundere romance.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Echoes 2020's Most Wholesome Rom-Com                  Shikimori sometimes expresses frustration toward Izumi, but even this is mainly because she wants to spend more time with him -- she doesn't pretend to like him less than she does. In Episode 2, she accused him of spending more time with his friend Inuzuka than with herself. She did this with intensity and conviction, but not so much that it was as if her personality had changed. Being calm sometimes and jealous and angry at other times doesn't necessarily make Shikimori a tsundere, it simply makes her human.  She may not be aggressive toward her romantic interest like a stereotypical tsundere, but she has shown the potential to be aggressive toward other characters. In Episode 1, Shikimori overheard a group of boys implying to Izumi that she was too good for him, much to her dismay. A sharp stare from her cool side was enough for the boys to collectively scream in fear, jumping when she slammed the door on them. When Shikimori was seemingly jealous of Inuzuka protecting Izumi from an errant volleyball in Episode 2, another intense stare left Inuzuka in a similar state of fear. Shikimori is clearly capable of both fury and fondness, but doesn't gradually move from one to the other in the story or oscillate unpredictably between the two. It seems clear from the Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie's first two episodes that the tsundere appellation doesn't fit her especially well. Even so, it is a term with many definitions which have changed over time, so it's understandable that fans could see this cute yet cool character as another evolution. Tsundere or not, Shikimori is making her own way as one of the most memorable new anime characters of the season.
