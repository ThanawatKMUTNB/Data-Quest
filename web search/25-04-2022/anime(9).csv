With double the runtime we'll probably get the same amount of content as the second season again, if they decide to do more than one cour (which seems unlikely, but isn't completely out of the window), we might even get to see more. Gonna be interesting to see how they will adapt it, given that Koharu was actually introduced around the point where the content of season two ended and would have been around the cast for quite some time by now.

Bummer that the first 4 episodes are retreads of old episodes, but maybe it is to set up the last 8 in style, we might be going after Fuji-san again?   Looking forward to this, one of my favorite short animes, glad to have it long.

Happy to have a new season and at full length episodes.    The first four episodes being compilations is odd, but from my understanding the anime doesn't follow the manga 1:1. For instance Koharu, the new girl being introduced, apparently should have showed up much earlier (Season 2 I think). So if the ""short stories"" being added in is to accommodate missing chapters, I think it'll work.

Especially with the first 4 eps being compilations of the previous seasons, it'll make things easier to watch it then.

With double the runtime we'll probably get the same amount of content as the second season again, if they decide to do more than one cour (which seems unlikely, but isn't completely out of the window), we might even get to see more. Gonna be interesting to see how they will adapt it, given that Koharu was actually introduced around the point where the content of season two ended and would have been around the cast for quite some time by now.

Bummer that the first 4 episodes are retreads of old episodes, but maybe it is to set up the last 8 in style, we might be going after Fuji-san again?   Looking forward to this, one of my favorite short animes, glad to have it long.

Happy to have a new season and at full length episodes.    The first four episodes being compilations is odd, but from my understanding the anime doesn't follow the manga 1:1. For instance Koharu, the new girl being introduced, apparently should have showed up much earlier (Season 2 I think). So if the ""short stories"" being added in is to accommodate missing chapters, I think it'll work.

Especially with the first 4 eps being compilations of the previous seasons, it'll make things easier to watch it then.

With double the runtime we'll probably get the same amount of content as the second season again, if they decide to do more than one cour (which seems unlikely, but isn't completely out of the window), we might even get to see more. Gonna be interesting to see how they will adapt it, given that Koharu was actually introduced around the point where the content of season two ended and would have been around the cast for quite some time by now.

Happy to have a new season and at full length episodes.    The first four episodes being compilations is odd, but from my understanding the anime doesn't follow the manga 1:1. For instance Koharu, the new girl being introduced, apparently should have showed up much earlier (Season 2 I think). So if the ""short stories"" being added in is to accommodate missing chapters, I think it'll work.

25-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/cms/discuss/184876,NEWS: Encouragement of Climb: Next Summit Anime Premieres in October With Half-Hour Episodes - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," This is my favorite anime. Happy to have a new season and at full length episodes.    The first four episodes being compilations is odd, but from my understanding the anime doesn't follow the manga 1:1. For instance Koharu, the new girl being introduced, apparently should have showed up much earlier (Season 2 I think). So if the ""short stories"" being added in is to accommodate missing chapters, I think it'll work.
