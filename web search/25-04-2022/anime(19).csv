The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

Back to top                   MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3973       Posted: Sat Apr 23, 2022 12:49 pm            Kashiwagi at first seemed like the only sane woman to Kaguya's antics, but now we see she can be just as excessive and obsessive when it comes to her relationships. And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

REVIEW: Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3973       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 1:39 pm            It's a season of Kaguya. The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

Back to top                   MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3973       Posted: Sat Apr 23, 2022 12:49 pm            Kashiwagi at first seemed like the only sane woman to Kaguya's antics, but now we see she can be just as excessive and obsessive when it comes to her relationships. And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

REVIEW: Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3973       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 1:39 pm            It's a season of Kaguya. The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma volume 1 game launched on September 2015.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma volume 1 game launched on September 2015.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band.

Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.         You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

In that case I wonder who this anime's Ma Su will be, considering how much attention was given to the story in episode 1.

It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

WANNFH wrote:      You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

In that case I wonder who this anime's Ma Su will be, considering how much attention was given to the story in episode 1.

The audience does have to remember her quite a bit since they actually need to know her name to look it up. Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event. I do agree that the anime is trying to have some commentary on success, but that's why I'm disappointed in how they handled this since instead of timing, planning or talent, her success seems to be more about plot armour.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief. But i totally get your point      Back to top                  Electric Wooloo    Joined: 19 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 196       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 8:23 am              meiam wrote:       MiloTheFirst wrote:    She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.         You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".            Interesting...  In that case I wonder who this anime's Ma Su will be, considering how much attention was given to the story in episode 1.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

In that case I wonder who this anime's Ma Su will be, considering how much attention was given to the story in episode 1.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief. But i totally get your point      Back to top                  Electric Wooloo    Joined: 19 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 196       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 8:23 am              meiam wrote:       MiloTheFirst wrote:    She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

In that case I wonder who this anime's Ma Su will be, considering how much attention was given to the story in episode 1.

She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation. I have not been to shibuya but I am willing to bet that isn't the norm for live presentations. Eitherway, the audience doesn't have to be blown away by her performance to decide subscribing to her instagram which is what kongming needs at this stage in order to get her jigs. The series seems to have some commentary going on about success depending more on timing and planning than actual talent. A musician doesn't need to be world class in order to be commercially successful, just clear a minimum bar of proficiency and figure out a great marketing strategy      Back to top                  KitKat1721    Joined: 03 Feb 2015 		    Posts: 715       Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 11:33 am            This feels like such a specific thing to point out, but I'm happy this show isn't a straight-up gag comedy because I 100% thought it would be based on the premise alone. Glad there's actually a little more there to get invested in/to keep up with.

If an English singer suddenly showed up at an event I went to and started singing in Japanese but massacred the pronunciation, I don't think I'd be able to tell since the lyric would just be gibberish to me either way.    The audience does have to remember her quite a bit since they actually need to know her name to look it up. Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event. I do agree that the anime is trying to have some commentary on success, but that's why I'm disappointed in how they handled this since instead of timing, planning or talent, her success seems to be more about plot armour.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief. But i totally get your point      Back to top                  Electric Wooloo    Joined: 19 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 196       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 8:23 am              meiam wrote:       MiloTheFirst wrote:    She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows?

Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.

Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy.

Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   Apr 25, 00:14 8 comments                 anime    Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures ― The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is.

I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears.

It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (303 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go.
