Chris Judge plays Kratos in the recent God of War games, Steve Blum's involvement in anime these days is limited to union stuff, if at all, and Christ Sabat is a name that gets noticed.  I'm assuming this probably had the budget to go and get particular actors.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.      Back to top                  MrTerrorist    Joined: 20 Oct 2010 		    Posts: 1203       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:38 am            For anyone curious what The Journey is about, it's a fictional retelling of an important event in Islamic history known as the Year of the Elephant, where an Aksumite General or King named Abraha, led an army with War Elephants to the city of Mecca to destroy their place of worship, the Kaaba, said to build by Abraham as instructed by God.    Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Saudi Arabia didn't have sanctions on their country that essentially makes their currency  worthless.  Businesses pulling out of Russia aren't doing it for moral reasons even if they might frame it that way.

Chris Judge plays Kratos in the recent God of War games, Steve Blum's involvement in anime these days is limited to union stuff, if at all, and Christ Sabat is a name that gets noticed.  I'm assuming this probably had the budget to go and get particular actors.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Chris Judge plays Kratos in the recent God of War games, Steve Blum's involvement in anime these days is limited to union stuff, if at all, and Christ Sabat is a name that gets noticed.  I'm assuming this probably had the budget to go and get particular actors.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.      Back to top                  MrTerrorist    Joined: 20 Oct 2010 		    Posts: 1203       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:38 am            For anyone curious what The Journey is about, it's a fictional retelling of an important event in Islamic history known as the Year of the Elephant, where an Aksumite General or King named Abraha, led an army with War Elephants to the city of Mecca to destroy their place of worship, the Kaaba, said to build by Abraham as instructed by God.    Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Chris Judge plays Kratos in the recent God of War games, Steve Blum's involvement in anime these days is limited to union stuff, if at all, and Christ Sabat is a name that gets noticed.  I'm assuming this probably had the budget to go and get particular actors.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Saudi Arabia didn't have sanctions on their country that essentially makes their currency  worthless.  Businesses pulling out of Russia aren't doing it for moral reasons even if they might frame it that way.

You would be right if any other Saudi production committee made the film with Toei, but considering this is literally the propaganda arm of MBS, I don't think passing on the film based on principle is unreasonable. The production committee and the Prince hinself are explicitly linked (as this article lays out). That said, if people want to see the film...cool, knock yourself out. Based on the trailer, the film looks fine.

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

Putin had murdered his share of opponents even outside of Russia's borders, and it wasn't that controversial before he started a big war (he started a few small land-grab wars too).  That said, I certainly wouldn't watch it before at the very least I'd pirate it and decide it's worth paying for the story, and there is so much anime that is not produced by murderers I doubt I'll get on to it any time soon.

Abraha wanted to destroy the Kaaba since Mecca was a popular site for religious pilgrims as Abraha build his own place of worship in his city wanted the pilgrims to come to his city and not Mecca. Abraha believed his invasion was justified since Mecca at the time practice idolatry and polytheism before Islam was founded. However, God was furious with Abraha's arrogance and greed for trying to destroy the Kaaba that when Abraha's army arrived at the outskirts of Mecca, the War Elephants refuses to go further as they knew the place was sacred and ran away, which a flock of birds sent by God drop stones on Abraha and his army, killing them.    As how fictional the movie is, here are some things i noticed:  * In the movie, the people of Mecca fought Abraha's army which didn't happen in the Year of the Elephant story.  * The people Mecca are portrayed as Monotheism while the Aksumite as Polytheism when in reality it was the other way around as I mentioned in the summary above and Abraha was believed to be a Christian.  * spoiler[Abraha survives the stoning from the flock of birds and fights the hero of the movie].

News Guilty Gear -Strive- Game's 'Another Story' DLC Launches on April 29   posted on 2022-04-23 04:20 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         DLC launches for season pass 1 holders    Arc System Works announced on Friday that it will launch the new ""Another Story"" DLC story for its Guilty Gear -Strive- fighting game on April 29.

The company describes the DLC:  While the incident in America triggered by Asuka R.

There she finds a girl who closely resembles “Bedman”, who once worked with the Universal Will against mankind.    The company also describes the new character Delilah (pictured above):  A young girl who has awoken from a long slumber.She's lived within a dream since her birth due to a unique condition caused by her brain's inability to withstand her exceptional intellect and abilities.As she's only just woken up, she doesn't have a solid grasp on common sense and social skills. Her one and only motive is to get revenge for her brother's life.  The game launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in June 2021, delayed from April 2021. Arc System Works previously delayed the release of the game from late 2020 due to the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Daisuke Ishiwatari is the game's general director, and Akira Katano is directing the game. The game's initial roster includes Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, May, Axl Low, Chipp Zanuff, Potemkin, Faust, Millia Rage, Zato-1, Ramlethal, Leo Whitefang, Nagoriyuki, Giovanna, Anji, and I-NO. The game's first DLC character Goldlewis Dickinson launched in July 2021. The second DLC character Jack O' launched last August. The third DLC character Happy Chaos launched on November 30 along with the game's new “Room Customization” feature. The fourth DLC character Baiken launched on January 28 along with the game's free ""Combo Maker"" update and an additional Battle Stage. The fifth DLC character Testament launched with the game's free ""Digital Figure Mode"" on March 28.    The first season pass of the game features five new characters, five colors for each character, two stages, and an extra story.     The game's ""Season 2"" DLC is in development and will include 4 additional characters.

News Guilty Gear -Strive- Game's 'Another Story' DLC Launches on April 29   posted on 2022-04-23 04:20 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         DLC launches for season pass 1 holders    Arc System Works announced on Friday that it will launch the new ""Another Story"" DLC story for its Guilty Gear -Strive- fighting game on April 29. The game will launch for season pass 1 holders on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam.     The DLC will feature characters that did not appear in the main story.    The company describes the DLC:  While the incident in America triggered by Asuka R. Kreutz's surrender unfolds…   Special Brigade Commander Ramlethal Valentine heads to the outskirts of Illyria after receiving report of an emergency.    There she finds a girl who closely resembles “Bedman”, who once worked with the Universal Will against mankind.    The company also describes the new character Delilah (pictured above):  A young girl who has awoken from a long slumber.She's lived within a dream since her birth due to a unique condition caused by her brain's inability to withstand her exceptional intellect and abilities.As she's only just woken up, she doesn't have a solid grasp on common sense and social skills. Her one and only motive is to get revenge for her brother's life.  The game launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in June 2021, delayed from April 2021. Arc System Works previously delayed the release of the game from late 2020 due to the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Daisuke Ishiwatari is the game's general director, and Akira Katano is directing the game. The game's initial roster includes Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, May, Axl Low, Chipp Zanuff, Potemkin, Faust, Millia Rage, Zato-1, Ramlethal, Leo Whitefang, Nagoriyuki, Giovanna, Anji, and I-NO. The game's first DLC character Goldlewis Dickinson launched in July 2021. The second DLC character Jack O' launched last August. The third DLC character Happy Chaos launched on November 30 along with the game's new “Room Customization” feature. The fourth DLC character Baiken launched on January 28 along with the game's free ""Combo Maker"" update and an additional Battle Stage. The fifth DLC character Testament launched with the game's free ""Digital Figure Mode"" on March 28.    The first season pass of the game features five new characters, five colors for each character, two stages, and an extra story.     The game's ""Season 2"" DLC is in development and will include 4 additional characters.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often.

I mean that honestly.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often.

I mean that honestly.

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering.

Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase.

I mean that honestly.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.0            I quite enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero. I found a lot of its action scenes as well as the different game-inspired abilities very fun to watch, and the main character Naofumi had a clear arc that was believable from beginning to end. Watching someone get dragged through the mud in some of the worst (at times to the point of feeling contrived) ways possible, only for them to persevere, earn the respect of those that truly matter around them, and walk away with a more confident sense of self was enjoyable. I actually would've been fine not getting a second season, because while the overall looming threat was still prevalent, I didn't really think there was a lot more that could've been done with our main character.    Season two begins by establishing this new status quo, which is a complete contrast to the way that season one started. Naofumi is now a well-respected Lord who has earned the admiration of the queen and is arguably the strongest of the four heroes. He still retains a little bit of his characteristic edge, but it's definitely a lot more tempered here, which is a sign of maturity. He also doesn't seem as quick-tempered as he did before, with only one major outburst towards the end of episode two triggered by people that didn't seem to be looking at the bigger picture. Even then, once he cooled his head and talked to Raphtalia, he exhibits a bit more of an open-minded optimism to cooperating with others. If you enjoyed the first season or specifically Naofumi as a character, then this shift in Naofumi's personality is probably one of the best things about these two episodes.    A large portion of these starting episodes is spent on exposition, with at least one scene in each episode revolving around a group of people sitting around and talking about a new random threat that is only loosely connected to the main threat of the Waves. Admittedly, the show could have done a better job at communicating visually just how much of a threat this creature poses; we are simply told about all the destruction it has caused and the stakes involved, which is apparently so intense that various nations needed to come together in order to put a stop to this threat.    Despite not being able to relate to the tension that is going on, I can still understand why the characters should care, which makes it all the more frustrating when we compare Naofumi's actions with that of the other three heroes. I understand they're supposed to be stubborn assholes who are still treating all of this like a game, but even from a general practicality standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense why they just dismissed this issue as something that they don't need to deal with even though it's made clear that most of the major cities will be destroyed if this threat isn't stopped. I really wish these characters had more internality to them because whenever they do show up, it feels like they're just there to make Naofumi look better. You can do that with one other hero, not three who are unified in that stubbornness despite apparently having different personalities. Without any insight into their individual thoughts and feelings, it just makes their actions come off as shortsighted, even when taking into consideration that they were looking at this more like a game.    This brings me to probably my biggest issue with season one of Shield Hero, which seemed to carry over to these two episodes. The show has a bit of a problem with exaggerating things when it really doesn't need to, whether it's questionable plot points, character personalities, or even understandable narrative leaps. Not only do we see this with the three heroes and the way that the exposition was unceremoniously dumped upon our heads, but I fear that it also seeped into what I can only assume is the next emotional core of the story revolving around Risha. I like Risha; she's a little one-note, but I like the idea of a more mature Naofumi being tasked with looking after somebody that is in a similar situation to him. The show heavily implies that she was unjustly kicked out of the Bow Hero's party out of spite and left with nowhere else to go. Season one ended with Naofumi relating to her situation and that does carry over here rather organically.    That said, one glaring issue that doesn't make sense to me is how she's continued to be portrayed as overly incompetent. She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party. However, the show kind of acts like she was always useless and that part of her arc is connected to overcoming that uselessness hence all the…training? If she was this useless then why would the Bow Hero even put up with her in the first place? Why did she need to be framed in order for her to be kicked out? Maybe her arc is more about overcoming her sense of inferiority rather than actually being useless, but if that's the case, then I don't know why the slave thing is even needed.    Yes, the slave thing – one of the most divisive aspects of this show. I'm not against slavery being used in a narrative context at all. I'm of the opinion that most real-world issues can and should (to a certain extent) be used as components of storytelling as long as they're used well. When the show started and Naofumi used Raphtalia as a slave, I actually thought that was an interesting narrative choice. The initial act of purchasing a slave was not glorified and framed more as a horrible act of desperation on Naofumi's part. However, it's everything that comes after that feels either overdone and inconsistent. For instance, I simply couldn't understand why the slave owner is still around. Season one even ended with an ominous narration from him as if he was foreshadowing major stuff that he would get Naofumi involved in. He even gets screen time specifically to turn Rishia into one of Naofumi's slaves. Is the show framing her as underpowered so that she would feel compelled to take the slave oath in order to get the power up? That said, I will admit that I really like that little bit of self-awareness that the show displays through Raphtalia. Naofumi pointing out that she is probably one of the very few people who would willingly let herself be enslaved even though it's not exactly necessary was not only funny, but also makes me eager to learn more about what's going on.    Again, Rishia's situation could have worked as an interesting parallel to Naofumi. Naofumi was so desperate to the point where he felt like he had no choice but to acquire a slave, whereas Rishia is someone who feels so useless to the point where she thinks actually being a slave will help her be more useful. However, as mentioned, the show hampers this by unnecessarily exaggerating Rishia's incompetence. Add in the fact that it's unclear why she would be so devoted to the Bow Hero when all we've seen of him is that he's kind of a cocky asshole, and it all feels like another example of the show overdoing things for the sake of communicating an idea that was already being set up in a more organic way. Maybe I'm reading too much into it and the show will justify its seemingly bizarre narrative choices down the line. Now that all the exposition is out of the way and we know what the big bad is and what's at stake, hopefully we will be able to continue this emotional narrative journey sooner rather than later.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.0            I quite enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero. I found a lot of its action scenes as well as the different game-inspired abilities very fun to watch, and the main character Naofumi had a clear arc that was believable from beginning to end. Watching someone get dragged through the mud in some of the worst (at times to the point of feeling contrived) ways possible, only for them to persevere, earn the respect of those that truly matter around them, and walk away with a more confident sense of self was enjoyable. I actually would've been fine not getting a second season, because while the overall looming threat was still prevalent, I didn't really think there was a lot more that could've been done with our main character.    Season two begins by establishing this new status quo, which is a complete contrast to the way that season one started. Naofumi is now a well-respected Lord who has earned the admiration of the queen and is arguably the strongest of the four heroes. He still retains a little bit of his characteristic edge, but it's definitely a lot more tempered here, which is a sign of maturity. He also doesn't seem as quick-tempered as he did before, with only one major outburst towards the end of episode two triggered by people that didn't seem to be looking at the bigger picture. Even then, once he cooled his head and talked to Raphtalia, he exhibits a bit more of an open-minded optimism to cooperating with others. If you enjoyed the first season or specifically Naofumi as a character, then this shift in Naofumi's personality is probably one of the best things about these two episodes.    A large portion of these starting episodes is spent on exposition, with at least one scene in each episode revolving around a group of people sitting around and talking about a new random threat that is only loosely connected to the main threat of the Waves. Admittedly, the show could have done a better job at communicating visually just how much of a threat this creature poses; we are simply told about all the destruction it has caused and the stakes involved, which is apparently so intense that various nations needed to come together in order to put a stop to this threat.    Despite not being able to relate to the tension that is going on, I can still understand why the characters should care, which makes it all the more frustrating when we compare Naofumi's actions with that of the other three heroes. I understand they're supposed to be stubborn assholes who are still treating all of this like a game, but even from a general practicality standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense why they just dismissed this issue as something that they don't need to deal with even though it's made clear that most of the major cities will be destroyed if this threat isn't stopped. I really wish these characters had more internality to them because whenever they do show up, it feels like they're just there to make Naofumi look better. You can do that with one other hero, not three who are unified in that stubbornness despite apparently having different personalities. Without any insight into their individual thoughts and feelings, it just makes their actions come off as shortsighted, even when taking into consideration that they were looking at this more like a game.    This brings me to probably my biggest issue with season one of Shield Hero, which seemed to carry over to these two episodes. The show has a bit of a problem with exaggerating things when it really doesn't need to, whether it's questionable plot points, character personalities, or even understandable narrative leaps. Not only do we see this with the three heroes and the way that the exposition was unceremoniously dumped upon our heads, but I fear that it also seeped into what I can only assume is the next emotional core of the story revolving around Risha. I like Risha; she's a little one-note, but I like the idea of a more mature Naofumi being tasked with looking after somebody that is in a similar situation to him. The show heavily implies that she was unjustly kicked out of the Bow Hero's party out of spite and left with nowhere else to go. Season one ended with Naofumi relating to her situation and that does carry over here rather organically.    That said, one glaring issue that doesn't make sense to me is how she's continued to be portrayed as overly incompetent. She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party. However, the show kind of acts like she was always useless and that part of her arc is connected to overcoming that uselessness hence all the…training? If she was this useless then why would the Bow Hero even put up with her in the first place? Why did she need to be framed in order for her to be kicked out? Maybe her arc is more about overcoming her sense of inferiority rather than actually being useless, but if that's the case, then I don't know why the slave thing is even needed.    Yes, the slave thing – one of the most divisive aspects of this show. I'm not against slavery being used in a narrative context at all. I'm of the opinion that most real-world issues can and should (to a certain extent) be used as components of storytelling as long as they're used well. When the show started and Naofumi used Raphtalia as a slave, I actually thought that was an interesting narrative choice. The initial act of purchasing a slave was not glorified and framed more as a horrible act of desperation on Naofumi's part. However, it's everything that comes after that feels either overdone and inconsistent. For instance, I simply couldn't understand why the slave owner is still around. Season one even ended with an ominous narration from him as if he was foreshadowing major stuff that he would get Naofumi involved in. He even gets screen time specifically to turn Rishia into one of Naofumi's slaves. Is the show framing her as underpowered so that she would feel compelled to take the slave oath in order to get the power up? That said, I will admit that I really like that little bit of self-awareness that the show displays through Raphtalia. Naofumi pointing out that she is probably one of the very few people who would willingly let herself be enslaved even though it's not exactly necessary was not only funny, but also makes me eager to learn more about what's going on.    Again, Rishia's situation could have worked as an interesting parallel to Naofumi. Naofumi was so desperate to the point where he felt like he had no choice but to acquire a slave, whereas Rishia is someone who feels so useless to the point where she thinks actually being a slave will help her be more useful. However, as mentioned, the show hampers this by unnecessarily exaggerating Rishia's incompetence. Add in the fact that it's unclear why she would be so devoted to the Bow Hero when all we've seen of him is that he's kind of a cocky asshole, and it all feels like another example of the show overdoing things for the sake of communicating an idea that was already being set up in a more organic way. Maybe I'm reading too much into it and the show will justify its seemingly bizarre narrative choices down the line. Now that all the exposition is out of the way and we know what the big bad is and what's at stake, hopefully we will be able to continue this emotional narrative journey sooner rather than later.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.0            I quite enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero. I found a lot of its action scenes as well as the different game-inspired abilities very fun to watch, and the main character Naofumi had a clear arc that was believable from beginning to end. Watching someone get dragged through the mud in some of the worst (at times to the point of feeling contrived) ways possible, only for them to persevere, earn the respect of those that truly matter around them, and walk away with a more confident sense of self was enjoyable. I actually would've been fine not getting a second season, because while the overall looming threat was still prevalent, I didn't really think there was a lot more that could've been done with our main character.    Season two begins by establishing this new status quo, which is a complete contrast to the way that season one started. Naofumi is now a well-respected Lord who has earned the admiration of the queen and is arguably the strongest of the four heroes. He still retains a little bit of his characteristic edge, but it's definitely a lot more tempered here, which is a sign of maturity. He also doesn't seem as quick-tempered as he did before, with only one major outburst towards the end of episode two triggered by people that didn't seem to be looking at the bigger picture. Even then, once he cooled his head and talked to Raphtalia, he exhibits a bit more of an open-minded optimism to cooperating with others. If you enjoyed the first season or specifically Naofumi as a character, then this shift in Naofumi's personality is probably one of the best things about these two episodes.    A large portion of these starting episodes is spent on exposition, with at least one scene in each episode revolving around a group of people sitting around and talking about a new random threat that is only loosely connected to the main threat of the Waves. Admittedly, the show could have done a better job at communicating visually just how much of a threat this creature poses; we are simply told about all the destruction it has caused and the stakes involved, which is apparently so intense that various nations needed to come together in order to put a stop to this threat.    Despite not being able to relate to the tension that is going on, I can still understand why the characters should care, which makes it all the more frustrating when we compare Naofumi's actions with that of the other three heroes. I understand they're supposed to be stubborn assholes who are still treating all of this like a game, but even from a general practicality standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense why they just dismissed this issue as something that they don't need to deal with even though it's made clear that most of the major cities will be destroyed if this threat isn't stopped. I really wish these characters had more internality to them because whenever they do show up, it feels like they're just there to make Naofumi look better. You can do that with one other hero, not three who are unified in that stubbornness despite apparently having different personalities. Without any insight into their individual thoughts and feelings, it just makes their actions come off as shortsighted, even when taking into consideration that they were looking at this more like a game.    This brings me to probably my biggest issue with season one of Shield Hero, which seemed to carry over to these two episodes. The show has a bit of a problem with exaggerating things when it really doesn't need to, whether it's questionable plot points, character personalities, or even understandable narrative leaps. Not only do we see this with the three heroes and the way that the exposition was unceremoniously dumped upon our heads, but I fear that it also seeped into what I can only assume is the next emotional core of the story revolving around Risha. I like Risha; she's a little one-note, but I like the idea of a more mature Naofumi being tasked with looking after somebody that is in a similar situation to him. The show heavily implies that she was unjustly kicked out of the Bow Hero's party out of spite and left with nowhere else to go. Season one ended with Naofumi relating to her situation and that does carry over here rather organically.    That said, one glaring issue that doesn't make sense to me is how she's continued to be portrayed as overly incompetent. She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party. However, the show kind of acts like she was always useless and that part of her arc is connected to overcoming that uselessness hence all the…training? If she was this useless then why would the Bow Hero even put up with her in the first place? Why did she need to be framed in order for her to be kicked out? Maybe her arc is more about overcoming her sense of inferiority rather than actually being useless, but if that's the case, then I don't know why the slave thing is even needed.    Yes, the slave thing – one of the most divisive aspects of this show. I'm not against slavery being used in a narrative context at all. I'm of the opinion that most real-world issues can and should (to a certain extent) be used as components of storytelling as long as they're used well. When the show started and Naofumi used Raphtalia as a slave, I actually thought that was an interesting narrative choice. The initial act of purchasing a slave was not glorified and framed more as a horrible act of desperation on Naofumi's part. However, it's everything that comes after that feels either overdone and inconsistent. For instance, I simply couldn't understand why the slave owner is still around. Season one even ended with an ominous narration from him as if he was foreshadowing major stuff that he would get Naofumi involved in. He even gets screen time specifically to turn Rishia into one of Naofumi's slaves. Is the show framing her as underpowered so that she would feel compelled to take the slave oath in order to get the power up? That said, I will admit that I really like that little bit of self-awareness that the show displays through Raphtalia. Naofumi pointing out that she is probably one of the very few people who would willingly let herself be enslaved even though it's not exactly necessary was not only funny, but also makes me eager to learn more about what's going on.    Again, Rishia's situation could have worked as an interesting parallel to Naofumi. Naofumi was so desperate to the point where he felt like he had no choice but to acquire a slave, whereas Rishia is someone who feels so useless to the point where she thinks actually being a slave will help her be more useful. However, as mentioned, the show hampers this by unnecessarily exaggerating Rishia's incompetence. Add in the fact that it's unclear why she would be so devoted to the Bow Hero when all we've seen of him is that he's kind of a cocky asshole, and it all feels like another example of the show overdoing things for the sake of communicating an idea that was already being set up in a more organic way. Maybe I'm reading too much into it and the show will justify its seemingly bizarre narrative choices down the line. Now that all the exposition is out of the way and we know what the big bad is and what's at stake, hopefully we will be able to continue this emotional narrative journey sooner rather than later.

A large portion of these starting episodes is spent on exposition, with at least one scene in each episode revolving around a group of people sitting around and talking about a new random threat that is only loosely connected to the main threat of the Waves. Admittedly, the show could have done a better job at communicating visually just how much of a threat this creature poses; we are simply told about all the destruction it has caused and the stakes involved, which is apparently so intense that various nations needed to come together in order to put a stop to this threat.    Despite not being able to relate to the tension that is going on, I can still understand why the characters should care, which makes it all the more frustrating when we compare Naofumi's actions with that of the other three heroes. I understand they're supposed to be stubborn assholes who are still treating all of this like a game, but even from a general practicality standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense why they just dismissed this issue as something that they don't need to deal with even though it's made clear that most of the major cities will be destroyed if this threat isn't stopped. I really wish these characters had more internality to them because whenever they do show up, it feels like they're just there to make Naofumi look better. You can do that with one other hero, not three who are unified in that stubbornness despite apparently having different personalities. Without any insight into their individual thoughts and feelings, it just makes their actions come off as shortsighted, even when taking into consideration that they were looking at this more like a game.    This brings me to probably my biggest issue with season one of Shield Hero, which seemed to carry over to these two episodes. The show has a bit of a problem with exaggerating things when it really doesn't need to, whether it's questionable plot points, character personalities, or even understandable narrative leaps. Not only do we see this with the three heroes and the way that the exposition was unceremoniously dumped upon our heads, but I fear that it also seeped into what I can only assume is the next emotional core of the story revolving around Risha. I like Risha; she's a little one-note, but I like the idea of a more mature Naofumi being tasked with looking after somebody that is in a similar situation to him. The show heavily implies that she was unjustly kicked out of the Bow Hero's party out of spite and left with nowhere else to go. Season one ended with Naofumi relating to her situation and that does carry over here rather organically.    That said, one glaring issue that doesn't make sense to me is how she's continued to be portrayed as overly incompetent. She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party. However, the show kind of acts like she was always useless and that part of her arc is connected to overcoming that uselessness hence all the…training? If she was this useless then why would the Bow Hero even put up with her in the first place? Why did she need to be framed in order for her to be kicked out? Maybe her arc is more about overcoming her sense of inferiority rather than actually being useless, but if that's the case, then I don't know why the slave thing is even needed.    Yes, the slave thing – one of the most divisive aspects of this show. I'm not against slavery being used in a narrative context at all. I'm of the opinion that most real-world issues can and should (to a certain extent) be used as components of storytelling as long as they're used well. When the show started and Naofumi used Raphtalia as a slave, I actually thought that was an interesting narrative choice. The initial act of purchasing a slave was not glorified and framed more as a horrible act of desperation on Naofumi's part. However, it's everything that comes after that feels either overdone and inconsistent. For instance, I simply couldn't understand why the slave owner is still around. Season one even ended with an ominous narration from him as if he was foreshadowing major stuff that he would get Naofumi involved in. He even gets screen time specifically to turn Rishia into one of Naofumi's slaves. Is the show framing her as underpowered so that she would feel compelled to take the slave oath in order to get the power up? That said, I will admit that I really like that little bit of self-awareness that the show displays through Raphtalia. Naofumi pointing out that she is probably one of the very few people who would willingly let herself be enslaved even though it's not exactly necessary was not only funny, but also makes me eager to learn more about what's going on.    Again, Rishia's situation could have worked as an interesting parallel to Naofumi. Naofumi was so desperate to the point where he felt like he had no choice but to acquire a slave, whereas Rishia is someone who feels so useless to the point where she thinks actually being a slave will help her be more useful. However, as mentioned, the show hampers this by unnecessarily exaggerating Rishia's incompetence. Add in the fact that it's unclear why she would be so devoted to the Bow Hero when all we've seen of him is that he's kind of a cocky asshole, and it all feels like another example of the show overdoing things for the sake of communicating an idea that was already being set up in a more organic way. Maybe I'm reading too much into it and the show will justify its seemingly bizarre narrative choices down the line. Now that all the exposition is out of the way and we know what the big bad is and what's at stake, hopefully we will be able to continue this emotional narrative journey sooner rather than later.

News Tatami Time Machine Blues Anime's Theatrical Screenings Start on September 30   posted on 2022-04-21 19:02 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Trailers for The Tatami Galaxy  sequel & In-Oh to air over next four weeks    The staff for the television anime of Tomihiko Morimi's Tatami Time Machine Blues (Yojō-Han Time Machine Blues) novel announced on Thursday that the anime's theatrical compilation film version will start its limited three-week run on September 30.        In addition, trailers (previewed in the visuals above) will air this month and next month during the ongoing rerun of The Tatami Galaxy television anime. The ""'Watashi' to Ozu no Eiga Yokoku"" (Ozu and I's Film Trailers) mini segments will debut footage from Tatami Time Machine Blues and also promote the INU-OH film's May 28 opening. The two Tatami Time Machine Blues trailers will air on April 28 and May 5, while the two INU-OH trailers will air on May 12 and May 19.    The lower-priced bunko edition of the Tatami Time Machine Blues novel will ship on June 10:          Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel to Morimi's earlier The Tatami Galaxy (Yojō-Han Shinwa Taikei) novel. It shipped in July 2020, 16 years after the original novel. The novel is inspired by Makoto Ueda's Summer Time Machine Blues stage play. Morimi wrote the novel, and Ueda, Morimi's friend, is credited with the original concept. The sequel novel combines elements of the stage play's story with the characters from Morimi's novel. Nakamura returned to illustrate the cover.    In the sequel novel's story, The Tatami Galaxy protagonist's trouble-making friend Ozu gets the student apartments' only air conditioner remote control wet, breaking it on a certain midsummer day. The students wonder what to do about the situation for the remainder of the summer and make a plan with Akashi. An unstylish male student from 25 years in the future arrives in a time machine. The protagonist travels back in time to try to retrieve the remote control before it is broken.    Most of the cast members are returning for the sequel anime, including Shintarō Asanuma as the protagonist ""I"" (Watashi), Maaya Sakamoto as Akashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu, Junichi Suwabe as Jōgasaki, and Yuko Kaida as Hanuki. Kazuya Nakai will voice Higuchi, replacing the character's original voice actor, the late Keiji Fujiwara.    Setsuji Satoh is returning from The Tatami Galaxy anime to reprise the role of Aijima, and Europe Kikaku's Chikara Honda is similarly reprising the Tamura-kun role from the Summer Time Machine Blues stage play and subsequent live-action film.    Shingo Natsume (One-Punch Man, Space Dandy, Sonny Boy) is directing the anime at Science SARU, and Makoto Ueda returns as scriptwriter from The Tatami Galaxy. Yūsuke Nakamura also returns as character designer.    The Walt Disney Company  will exclusively stream the new anime globally, including on the Disney+ service in Japan in 2022.  The Disney+ version will include an original episode that will not be shown in theaters.    Ohta Publishing released Morimi's original novel in 2005, with Nakamura illustrating the cover. The novel inspired an 11-episode anime by Masaaki Yuasa in April 2010.    HarperCollins' HarperVia imprint will publish The Tatami Galaxy novel in English in fall of 2022. The release will be followed with the sequel novel Tatami Time Machine Blues in summer of 2023. Emily Balistrieri is translating both novels. Balistrieri previously translated Morimi's The Night is Young, Walk on Girl novel, which inspired a 2017 anime film also directed by Masaaki Yuasa off a screenplay by Ueda.

News Tatami Time Machine Blues Anime's Theatrical Screenings Start on September 30   posted on 2022-04-21 19:02 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Trailers for The Tatami Galaxy  sequel & In-Oh to air over next four weeks    The staff for the television anime of Tomihiko Morimi's Tatami Time Machine Blues (Yojō-Han Time Machine Blues) novel announced on Thursday that the anime's theatrical compilation film version will start its limited three-week run on September 30.        In addition, trailers (previewed in the visuals above) will air this month and next month during the ongoing rerun of The Tatami Galaxy television anime. The ""'Watashi' to Ozu no Eiga Yokoku"" (Ozu and I's Film Trailers) mini segments will debut footage from Tatami Time Machine Blues and also promote the INU-OH film's May 28 opening. The two Tatami Time Machine Blues trailers will air on April 28 and May 5, while the two INU-OH trailers will air on May 12 and May 19.    The lower-priced bunko edition of the Tatami Time Machine Blues novel will ship on June 10:          Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel to Morimi's earlier The Tatami Galaxy (Yojō-Han Shinwa Taikei) novel. It shipped in July 2020, 16 years after the original novel. The novel is inspired by Makoto Ueda's Summer Time Machine Blues stage play. Morimi wrote the novel, and Ueda, Morimi's friend, is credited with the original concept. The sequel novel combines elements of the stage play's story with the characters from Morimi's novel. Nakamura returned to illustrate the cover.    In the sequel novel's story, The Tatami Galaxy protagonist's trouble-making friend Ozu gets the student apartments' only air conditioner remote control wet, breaking it on a certain midsummer day. The students wonder what to do about the situation for the remainder of the summer and make a plan with Akashi. An unstylish male student from 25 years in the future arrives in a time machine. The protagonist travels back in time to try to retrieve the remote control before it is broken.    Most of the cast members are returning for the sequel anime, including Shintarō Asanuma as the protagonist ""I"" (Watashi), Maaya Sakamoto as Akashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu, Junichi Suwabe as Jōgasaki, and Yuko Kaida as Hanuki. Kazuya Nakai will voice Higuchi, replacing the character's original voice actor, the late Keiji Fujiwara.    Setsuji Satoh is returning from The Tatami Galaxy anime to reprise the role of Aijima, and Europe Kikaku's Chikara Honda is similarly reprising the Tamura-kun role from the Summer Time Machine Blues stage play and subsequent live-action film.    Shingo Natsume (One-Punch Man, Space Dandy, Sonny Boy) is directing the anime at Science SARU, and Makoto Ueda returns as scriptwriter from The Tatami Galaxy. Yūsuke Nakamura also returns as character designer.    The Walt Disney Company  will exclusively stream the new anime globally, including on the Disney+ service in Japan in 2022.  The Disney+ version will include an original episode that will not be shown in theaters.    Ohta Publishing released Morimi's original novel in 2005, with Nakamura illustrating the cover. The novel inspired an 11-episode anime by Masaaki Yuasa in April 2010.    HarperCollins' HarperVia imprint will publish The Tatami Galaxy novel in English in fall of 2022. The release will be followed with the sequel novel Tatami Time Machine Blues in summer of 2023. Emily Balistrieri is translating both novels. Balistrieri previously translated Morimi's The Night is Young, Walk on Girl novel, which inspired a 2017 anime film also directed by Masaaki Yuasa off a screenplay by Ueda.

News Tatami Time Machine Blues Anime's Theatrical Screenings Start on September 30   posted on 2022-04-21 19:02 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Trailers for The Tatami Galaxy  sequel & In-Oh to air over next four weeks    The staff for the television anime of Tomihiko Morimi's Tatami Time Machine Blues (Yojō-Han Time Machine Blues) novel announced on Thursday that the anime's theatrical compilation film version will start its limited three-week run on September 30.        In addition, trailers (previewed in the visuals above) will air this month and next month during the ongoing rerun of The Tatami Galaxy television anime. The ""'Watashi' to Ozu no Eiga Yokoku"" (Ozu and I's Film Trailers) mini segments will debut footage from Tatami Time Machine Blues and also promote the INU-OH film's May 28 opening. The two Tatami Time Machine Blues trailers will air on April 28 and May 5, while the two INU-OH trailers will air on May 12 and May 19.    The lower-priced bunko edition of the Tatami Time Machine Blues novel will ship on June 10:          Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel to Morimi's earlier The Tatami Galaxy (Yojō-Han Shinwa Taikei) novel. It shipped in July 2020, 16 years after the original novel. The novel is inspired by Makoto Ueda's Summer Time Machine Blues stage play. Morimi wrote the novel, and Ueda, Morimi's friend, is credited with the original concept. The sequel novel combines elements of the stage play's story with the characters from Morimi's novel. Nakamura returned to illustrate the cover.    In the sequel novel's story, The Tatami Galaxy protagonist's trouble-making friend Ozu gets the student apartments' only air conditioner remote control wet, breaking it on a certain midsummer day. The students wonder what to do about the situation for the remainder of the summer and make a plan with Akashi. An unstylish male student from 25 years in the future arrives in a time machine. The protagonist travels back in time to try to retrieve the remote control before it is broken.    Most of the cast members are returning for the sequel anime, including Shintarō Asanuma as the protagonist ""I"" (Watashi), Maaya Sakamoto as Akashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu, Junichi Suwabe as Jōgasaki, and Yuko Kaida as Hanuki. Kazuya Nakai will voice Higuchi, replacing the character's original voice actor, the late Keiji Fujiwara.    Setsuji Satoh is returning from The Tatami Galaxy anime to reprise the role of Aijima, and Europe Kikaku's Chikara Honda is similarly reprising the Tamura-kun role from the Summer Time Machine Blues stage play and subsequent live-action film.    Shingo Natsume (One-Punch Man, Space Dandy, Sonny Boy) is directing the anime at Science SARU, and Makoto Ueda returns as scriptwriter from The Tatami Galaxy. Yūsuke Nakamura also returns as character designer.    The Walt Disney Company  will exclusively stream the new anime globally, including on the Disney+ service in Japan in 2022.  The Disney+ version will include an original episode that will not be shown in theaters.    Ohta Publishing released Morimi's original novel in 2005, with Nakamura illustrating the cover. The novel inspired an 11-episode anime by Masaaki Yuasa in April 2010.    HarperCollins' HarperVia imprint will publish The Tatami Galaxy novel in English in fall of 2022. The release will be followed with the sequel novel Tatami Time Machine Blues in summer of 2023. Emily Balistrieri is translating both novels. Balistrieri previously translated Morimi's The Night is Young, Walk on Girl novel, which inspired a 2017 anime film also directed by Masaaki Yuasa off a screenplay by Ueda.
