Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place.

Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

I would be very surprised if they did but after following these things for years I've learned to not expect anything until it actually happens and then you won't be disappointed when nothing happens.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

I would be very surprised if they did but after following these things for years I've learned to not expect anything until it actually happens and then you won't be disappointed when nothing happens.

I would be very surprised if they did but after following these things for years I've learned to not expect anything until it actually happens and then you won't be disappointed when nothing happens.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it.

Higround Announces Attack on Titan Collaboration   Apr 23rd 2022         The Higround x Attack on Titan capsule pushes the limits on anime and hardware collaborations, featuring two unique keyboard and mousepad designs, two sets of 1.5 mm PBT keycaps, and a printed jelly bag.  Higround, a lifestyle and gaming peripheral brand, is pleased to announce its upcoming Attack on Titan collaboration - a collection of computer peripherals inspired by the iconic Japanese manga series. In partnership with Funimation, Higround redefines anime merchandise by combining functionality and art, offering a new perspective on computer peripherals. The entire collection will be available exclusively on Higround's website in the coming weeks.  Featuring dual silicone dampeners, this Higround capsule offers users the experience of having a heavier, deeper-sounding keyboard without personal modifications. The keyboards feature TTC Titan Heart switches exclusive to Higround, which feature smoked black housing and a red heart embedded inside. These unique features and visuals merge Higround's dedication to detail and reliability with Attack on Titan's themes of resilience for a collection of quality, durable products designed to weather the storm.   Higround's collaboration with Attack on Titan tells a story about dedication to self expression. Wrapped in the iconic imagery from Attack on Titan, the two keyboard designs included in the capsule feature images of Captain Levi and the Colossus Titan—two characters known for their tenacity and perseverance.  “This is the first time in the industry you'll see inspired designs that incorporate anime graphics across the keyboard,” said Higround Founder and CEO Rustin Sotoodeh. ""It's energizing because we love telling stories and now we get to borrow Attack on Titan's rich storyline and characters and portray it through the medium of graphic keyboards.”  As gaming and anime continue to immerse users into worlds of adventure and storytelling, this is the first time that fans of both can integrate this merging of cultures into their keyboards. As Higround's inaugural venture into anime hardware, it was only natural to collaborate with Attack on Titan. Growing in popularity across four seasons, Attack on Titan is the forerunner across all anime genres and has proven to the masses that great storytelling knows no bounds.   Higround was acquired by 100 Thieves in November 2021 and has since sold out of all drops in under 10 minutes. This limited drop will be available to customers in the coming weeks.

Higround Announces Attack on Titan Collaboration   Apr 23rd 2022         The Higround x Attack on Titan capsule pushes the limits on anime and hardware collaborations, featuring two unique keyboard and mousepad designs, two sets of 1.5 mm PBT keycaps, and a printed jelly bag.  Higround, a lifestyle and gaming peripheral brand, is pleased to announce its upcoming Attack on Titan collaboration - a collection of computer peripherals inspired by the iconic Japanese manga series. In partnership with Funimation, Higround redefines anime merchandise by combining functionality and art, offering a new perspective on computer peripherals. The entire collection will be available exclusively on Higround's website in the coming weeks.  Featuring dual silicone dampeners, this Higround capsule offers users the experience of having a heavier, deeper-sounding keyboard without personal modifications. The keyboards feature TTC Titan Heart switches exclusive to Higround, which feature smoked black housing and a red heart embedded inside. These unique features and visuals merge Higround's dedication to detail and reliability with Attack on Titan's themes of resilience for a collection of quality, durable products designed to weather the storm.   Higround's collaboration with Attack on Titan tells a story about dedication to self expression. Wrapped in the iconic imagery from Attack on Titan, the two keyboard designs included in the capsule feature images of Captain Levi and the Colossus Titan—two characters known for their tenacity and perseverance.  “This is the first time in the industry you'll see inspired designs that incorporate anime graphics across the keyboard,” said Higround Founder and CEO Rustin Sotoodeh. ""It's energizing because we love telling stories and now we get to borrow Attack on Titan's rich storyline and characters and portray it through the medium of graphic keyboards.”  As gaming and anime continue to immerse users into worlds of adventure and storytelling, this is the first time that fans of both can integrate this merging of cultures into their keyboards. As Higround's inaugural venture into anime hardware, it was only natural to collaborate with Attack on Titan. Growing in popularity across four seasons, Attack on Titan is the forerunner across all anime genres and has proven to the masses that great storytelling knows no bounds.   Higround was acquired by 100 Thieves in November 2021 and has since sold out of all drops in under 10 minutes. This limited drop will be available to customers in the coming weeks.

Higround Announces Attack on Titan Collaboration   Apr 23rd 2022         The Higround x Attack on Titan capsule pushes the limits on anime and hardware collaborations, featuring two unique keyboard and mousepad designs, two sets of 1.5 mm PBT keycaps, and a printed jelly bag.  Higround, a lifestyle and gaming peripheral brand, is pleased to announce its upcoming Attack on Titan collaboration - a collection of computer peripherals inspired by the iconic Japanese manga series. In partnership with Funimation, Higround redefines anime merchandise by combining functionality and art, offering a new perspective on computer peripherals. The entire collection will be available exclusively on Higround's website in the coming weeks.  Featuring dual silicone dampeners, this Higround capsule offers users the experience of having a heavier, deeper-sounding keyboard without personal modifications. The keyboards feature TTC Titan Heart switches exclusive to Higround, which feature smoked black housing and a red heart embedded inside. These unique features and visuals merge Higround's dedication to detail and reliability with Attack on Titan's themes of resilience for a collection of quality, durable products designed to weather the storm.   Higround's collaboration with Attack on Titan tells a story about dedication to self expression. Wrapped in the iconic imagery from Attack on Titan, the two keyboard designs included in the capsule feature images of Captain Levi and the Colossus Titan—two characters known for their tenacity and perseverance.  “This is the first time in the industry you'll see inspired designs that incorporate anime graphics across the keyboard,” said Higround Founder and CEO Rustin Sotoodeh. ""It's energizing because we love telling stories and now we get to borrow Attack on Titan's rich storyline and characters and portray it through the medium of graphic keyboards.”  As gaming and anime continue to immerse users into worlds of adventure and storytelling, this is the first time that fans of both can integrate this merging of cultures into their keyboards. As Higround's inaugural venture into anime hardware, it was only natural to collaborate with Attack on Titan. Growing in popularity across four seasons, Attack on Titan is the forerunner across all anime genres and has proven to the masses that great storytelling knows no bounds.   Higround was acquired by 100 Thieves in November 2021 and has since sold out of all drops in under 10 minutes. This limited drop will be available to customers in the coming weeks.

Higround, a lifestyle and gaming peripheral brand, is pleased to announce its upcoming Attack on Titan collaboration - a collection of computer peripherals inspired by the iconic Japanese manga series. In partnership with Funimation, Higround redefines anime merchandise by combining functionality and art, offering a new perspective on computer peripherals. The entire collection will be available exclusively on Higround's website in the coming weeks.  Featuring dual silicone dampeners, this Higround capsule offers users the experience of having a heavier, deeper-sounding keyboard without personal modifications. The keyboards feature TTC Titan Heart switches exclusive to Higround, which feature smoked black housing and a red heart embedded inside. These unique features and visuals merge Higround's dedication to detail and reliability with Attack on Titan's themes of resilience for a collection of quality, durable products designed to weather the storm.   Higround's collaboration with Attack on Titan tells a story about dedication to self expression. Wrapped in the iconic imagery from Attack on Titan, the two keyboard designs included in the capsule feature images of Captain Levi and the Colossus Titan—two characters known for their tenacity and perseverance.  “This is the first time in the industry you'll see inspired designs that incorporate anime graphics across the keyboard,” said Higround Founder and CEO Rustin Sotoodeh. ""It's energizing because we love telling stories and now we get to borrow Attack on Titan's rich storyline and characters and portray it through the medium of graphic keyboards.”  As gaming and anime continue to immerse users into worlds of adventure and storytelling, this is the first time that fans of both can integrate this merging of cultures into their keyboards. As Higround's inaugural venture into anime hardware, it was only natural to collaborate with Attack on Titan. Growing in popularity across four seasons, Attack on Titan is the forerunner across all anime genres and has proven to the masses that great storytelling knows no bounds.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

That said, we are at 8 dubs for this season and for the 6 TX in house dubs, no remote actors at all. I certainly will be keeping up with SPY x FAMILY and I liked Aharen from what I watched, but to reiterate what's been mentioned in other posts for these dub announcements, seems like a disappointment in not having a wider pool of actors that we saw before and the great results we got from that.   It will be opportunity for some though, I am curious to see to how it goes, just wish it wasn't in part from a backwards step.

The company has rebranded as Crunchyroll, but the staff in Texas is calling the shots.

Of course Julie Shields is a little less recognizable a name.    I feel kind of bad for LA anime VA's at this point because it seems like all they'll have left is sequels, Netflix dubs, and JRPG's. Because they're probably not going to be in a Funimation dub otherwise unless it's a reprisal.

I think Alexis Tipton, Sarah Wiedenheft and Kyle Phillips are the only VAs in this cast I recognize.

You talk like if CR would suddenly abandon STUDIOPOLIS and BangZoom at the drop of the hat outside of sequels, because one studio alone can't handle that much 26 titles in one season, there has to be a balance.   Also, there's Disney+ coming around the corner, and there's Aniplex as well in that regard.

Jeremy Inman is capable of producing far more striking casting results yet he refuses to shake it up just slides back into what is clearly his comfort zone which just doesn't interest me as a dubbing fan you guys can do so much better. It may come down to that Inman needs to network more within his dubbing community to have the opportunity to cast outside the same 30 set of voice actors that he insists on casting on every ADR directing project. The few positives I see in the cast is the return of Molly Searcy in a Dallas dub and the underrated Jeff Johnson well in true we don't give a shit fashion Crunchyroll didn't credit them to their characters.

They didn't want to work on nonunion dubs for Sony anymore and that's exactly what they're getting. It's just not happening the way they wanted it to.   At least the LA VAs won't be completely shunned from appearing in anime, like what happened to the actors of Calgary, NYC, Vancouver and Wilmington. As you mentioned, they have work that's more or less guaranteed.

That said, we are at 8 dubs for this season and for the 6 TX in house dubs, no remote actors at all. I certainly will be keeping up with SPY x FAMILY and I liked Aharen from what I watched, but to reiterate what's been mentioned in other posts for these dub announcements, seems like a disappointment in not having a wider pool of actors that we saw before and the great results we got from that.   It will be opportunity for some though, I am curious to see to how it goes, just wish it wasn't in part from a backwards step.

The company has rebranded as Crunchyroll, but the staff in Texas is calling the shots.

Of course Julie Shields is a little less recognizable a name.    I feel kind of bad for LA anime VA's at this point because it seems like all they'll have left is sequels, Netflix dubs, and JRPG's.

You talk like if CR would suddenly abandon STUDIOPOLIS and BangZoom at the drop of the hat outside of sequels, because one studio alone can't handle that much 26 titles in one season, there has to be a balance.   Also, there's Disney+ coming around the corner, and there's Aniplex as well in that regard.

Jeremy Inman is capable of producing far more striking casting results yet he refuses to shake it up just slides back into what is clearly his comfort zone which just doesn't interest me as a dubbing fan you guys can do so much better. It may come down to that Inman needs to network more within his dubbing community to have the opportunity to cast outside the same 30 set of voice actors that he insists on casting on every ADR directing project. The few positives I see in the cast is the return of Molly Searcy in a Dallas dub and the underrated Jeff Johnson well in true we don't give a shit fashion Crunchyroll didn't credit them to their characters.

They didn't want to work on nonunion dubs for Sony anymore and that's exactly what they're getting. It's just not happening the way they wanted it to.   At least the LA VAs won't be completely shunned from appearing in anime, like what happened to the actors of Calgary, NYC, Vancouver and Wilmington. As you mentioned, they have work that's more or less guaranteed.

That said, we are at 8 dubs for this season and for the 6 TX in house dubs, no remote actors at all. I certainly will be keeping up with SPY x FAMILY and I liked Aharen from what I watched, but to reiterate what's been mentioned in other posts for these dub announcements, seems like a disappointment in not having a wider pool of actors that we saw before and the great results we got from that.   It will be opportunity for some though, I am curious to see to how it goes, just wish it wasn't in part from a backwards step.

The company has rebranded as Crunchyroll, but the staff in Texas is calling the shots.

Of course Julie Shields is a little less recognizable a name.    I feel kind of bad for LA anime VA's at this point because it seems like all they'll have left is sequels, Netflix dubs, and JRPG's. Because they're probably not going to be in a Funimation dub otherwise unless it's a reprisal.

I think Alexis Tipton, Sarah Wiedenheft and Kyle Phillips are the only VAs in this cast I recognize.

You talk like if CR would suddenly abandon STUDIOPOLIS and BangZoom at the drop of the hat outside of sequels, because one studio alone can't handle that much 26 titles in one season, there has to be a balance.   Also, there's Disney+ coming around the corner, and there's Aniplex as well in that regard.

Jeremy Inman is capable of producing far more striking casting results yet he refuses to shake it up just slides back into what is clearly his comfort zone which just doesn't interest me as a dubbing fan you guys can do so much better. It may come down to that Inman needs to network more within his dubbing community to have the opportunity to cast outside the same 30 set of voice actors that he insists on casting on every ADR directing project. The few positives I see in the cast is the return of Molly Searcy in a Dallas dub and the underrated Jeff Johnson well in true we don't give a shit fashion Crunchyroll didn't credit them to their characters.

They didn't want to work on nonunion dubs for Sony anymore and that's exactly what they're getting. It's just not happening the way they wanted it to.   At least the LA VAs won't be completely shunned from appearing in anime, like what happened to the actors of Calgary, NYC, Vancouver and Wilmington. As you mentioned, they have work that's more or less guaranteed.

That said, we are at 8 dubs for this season and for the 6 TX in house dubs, no remote actors at all. I certainly will be keeping up with SPY x FAMILY and I liked Aharen from what I watched, but to reiterate what's been mentioned in other posts for these dub announcements, seems like a disappointment in not having a wider pool of actors that we saw before and the great results we got from that.   It will be opportunity for some though, I am curious to see to how it goes, just wish it wasn't in part from a backwards step.

You talk like if CR would suddenly abandon STUDIOPOLIS and BangZoom at the drop of the hat outside of sequels, because one studio alone can't handle that much 26 titles in one season, there has to be a balance.   Also, there's Disney+ coming around the corner, and there's Aniplex as well in that regard.

Jeremy Inman is capable of producing far more striking casting results yet he refuses to shake it up just slides back into what is clearly his comfort zone which just doesn't interest me as a dubbing fan you guys can do so much better. It may come down to that Inman needs to network more within his dubbing community to have the opportunity to cast outside the same 30 set of voice actors that he insists on casting on every ADR directing project. The few positives I see in the cast is the return of Molly Searcy in a Dallas dub and the underrated Jeff Johnson well in true we don't give a shit fashion Crunchyroll didn't credit them to their characters.

They didn't want to work on nonunion dubs for Sony anymore and that's exactly what they're getting. It's just not happening the way they wanted it to.   At least the LA VAs won't be completely shunned from appearing in anime, like what happened to the actors of Calgary, NYC, Vancouver and Wilmington.

Jeremy Inman is capable of producing far more striking casting results yet he refuses to shake it up just slides back into what is clearly his comfort zone which just doesn't interest me as a dubbing fan you guys can do so much better.

The few positives I see in the cast is the return of Molly Searcy in a Dallas dub and the underrated Jeff Johnson well in true we don't give a shit fashion Crunchyroll didn't credit them to their characters.

Jeremy Inman is capable of producing far more striking casting results yet he refuses to shake it up just slides back into what is clearly his comfort zone which just doesn't interest me as a dubbing fan you guys can do so much better. It may come down to that Inman needs to network more within his dubbing community to have the opportunity to cast outside the same 30 set of voice actors that he insists on casting on every ADR directing project. The few positives I see in the cast is the return of Molly Searcy in a Dallas dub and the underrated Jeff Johnson well in true we don't give a shit fashion Crunchyroll didn't credit them to their characters.

News Kōkyū no Karasu Anime's Promo Video Previews Characters' Voices   posted on 2022-04-21 21:48 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime based on novel series premieres in October    Aniplex began streaming a teaser promotional video for the television anime of Kōko Shirakawa's Kōkyū no Karasu (A Raven in the Harem) novel series on Thursday.

Chizuru Miyawaki (Gintama TV anime, Gintama: The Final) is directing the anime at BN Pictures, and Satomi Ooshima (Fortune Favors Lady Nikuko) is overseeing the series scripts. Shinji Takeuchi (Fairy Tail, Gintama') is adapting Ayuko's original character designs for animation. Asami Tachibana (DARLING in the FRANXX, Haikyu!!, Moriarty the Patriot) is composing the music.    The novels' story centers on Uki, an imperial concubine who has never been called to the emperor's bedchambers, and maintains a singularly unique life within the harem chambers.

When a circumstance makes the emperor call on her, their meeting will change history.    Shirakawa launched the novel series with illustrations by Ayuko (The Earl & the Fairy) in April 2018. The seventh and final volume shipped on Thursday.

News Crunchyroll Debuts Estab-Life: Great Escape Anime's English Dub on Wednesday   posted on 2022-04-20 09:55 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Dub stars Julie Shields, Alexis Tipton, Sarah Wiedenheft, Cris George, Anthony Bowling, more    Crunchyroll announced on Tuesday that its English dub for the Estab-Life: Great Escape original anime project by Goro Taniguchi will debut with the first episode on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. EDT. The dub's cast, under ADR Director Jeremy Inman, ADR engineer Jeremy Woods, ADR script writer Jarrod Greene, and ADR mix engineer William Dewell, includes:     Julie Shields as Equa   Alexis Tipton as Feles   Sarah Wiedenheft as Martes   Cris George as Ulula   Anthony Bowling as Alga   Molly Searcy   Lucía Lobosvilla   Dusty Feeney   Kelsey Maher   Rachel Thompson   Kyle Phillips   Jeff Johnson   Rex Underwood   Jim Foronda   Larry Brantley    The first four episodes of the show began streaming on the FOD service in Japan on March 1. The show then premiered on television on April 6 on the +Ultra anime programming block on Fuji TV and its affiliates, and Crunchyroll streams the anime outside Asia.    The anime stars:     Tomomi Mineuchi as Equa, the Nigashiya leader   Rie Takahashi as Feles, the superbly athletic, quick-firing ""gun wizard""  Maria Naganawa as Martes, a slime-human  Sho Hayami as Alga, an old fogey of an AI robot  Shinichiro Miki as Ulula, a wolfman who says nothing but ""wan"" (woof)   The project will have a television anime, smartphone game, and anime film, which have the themes of ""escape,"" ""records,"" and ""variant,"" respectively. (The English subtitle for Estab Life is ""Establishment in Life."")    The story is set in the distant future when the world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence.    Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Taniguchi is credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the Estab-Life: Great Escape television anime, and SSF is credited with the original story. Hiroyuki Hashimoto (Is the order a rabbit?, Slow Start) is directing the anime at Polygon Pictures, and Shoji Gatoh (Full Metal Panic!, Hyou-ka, Cop Craft) is supervising and writing the scripts.    Yūsuke Kozaki (No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, Fire Emblem Awakening, Bubuki Buranki) drafted the original character designs, and INEI's Kenichiro Tomiyasu (Harlock: Space Pirate, Human Lost, Night Head 2041, Resident Evil: Damnation) drafted the concept art. Yoshiaki Fujisawa (No Game, No Life Zero, A Place Further Than the Universe, Revue Starlight) is composing the music. Slow Curve developed and produced the project.    Five-member band GOOD ON THE REEL perform the ending theme song ""0.""    Square Enix is developing the Estab-Life: Unity Memories smartphone game. Taniguchi is also credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the game, and SSF likewise is credited with the original story.    Taniguchi is also personally directing and writing Eiga Estab-Life: Revengers' Road (Estab-Life the Movie: Revengers' Road), in addition to conceiving the original concept. SSF is again credited with the original story, and Polygon Pictures is producing the animation.

News Crunchyroll Debuts Estab-Life: Great Escape Anime's English Dub on Wednesday   posted on 2022-04-20 09:55 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Dub stars Julie Shields, Alexis Tipton, Sarah Wiedenheft, Cris George, Anthony Bowling, more    Crunchyroll announced on Tuesday that its English dub for the Estab-Life: Great Escape original anime project by Goro Taniguchi will debut with the first episode on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. EDT. The dub's cast, under ADR Director Jeremy Inman, ADR engineer Jeremy Woods, ADR script writer Jarrod Greene, and ADR mix engineer William Dewell, includes:     Julie Shields as Equa   Alexis Tipton as Feles   Sarah Wiedenheft as Martes   Cris George as Ulula   Anthony Bowling as Alga   Molly Searcy   Lucía Lobosvilla   Dusty Feeney   Kelsey Maher   Rachel Thompson   Kyle Phillips   Jeff Johnson   Rex Underwood   Jim Foronda   Larry Brantley    The first four episodes of the show began streaming on the FOD service in Japan on March 1. The show then premiered on television on April 6 on the +Ultra anime programming block on Fuji TV and its affiliates, and Crunchyroll streams the anime outside Asia.    The anime stars:     Tomomi Mineuchi as Equa, the Nigashiya leader   Rie Takahashi as Feles, the superbly athletic, quick-firing ""gun wizard""  Maria Naganawa as Martes, a slime-human  Sho Hayami as Alga, an old fogey of an AI robot  Shinichiro Miki as Ulula, a wolfman who says nothing but ""wan"" (woof)   The project will have a television anime, smartphone game, and anime film, which have the themes of ""escape,"" ""records,"" and ""variant,"" respectively. (The English subtitle for Estab Life is ""Establishment in Life."")    The story is set in the distant future when the world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence.    Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Taniguchi is credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the Estab-Life: Great Escape television anime, and SSF is credited with the original story. Hiroyuki Hashimoto (Is the order a rabbit?, Slow Start) is directing the anime at Polygon Pictures, and Shoji Gatoh (Full Metal Panic!, Hyou-ka, Cop Craft) is supervising and writing the scripts.    Yūsuke Kozaki (No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, Fire Emblem Awakening, Bubuki Buranki) drafted the original character designs, and INEI's Kenichiro Tomiyasu (Harlock: Space Pirate, Human Lost, Night Head 2041, Resident Evil: Damnation) drafted the concept art. Yoshiaki Fujisawa (No Game, No Life Zero, A Place Further Than the Universe, Revue Starlight) is composing the music. Slow Curve developed and produced the project.    Five-member band GOOD ON THE REEL perform the ending theme song ""0.""    Square Enix is developing the Estab-Life: Unity Memories smartphone game. Taniguchi is also credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the game, and SSF likewise is credited with the original story.    Taniguchi is also personally directing and writing Eiga Estab-Life: Revengers' Road (Estab-Life the Movie: Revengers' Road), in addition to conceiving the original concept. SSF is again credited with the original story, and Polygon Pictures is producing the animation.

News Crunchyroll Debuts Estab-Life: Great Escape Anime's English Dub on Wednesday   posted on 2022-04-20 09:55 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Dub stars Julie Shields, Alexis Tipton, Sarah Wiedenheft, Cris George, Anthony Bowling, more    Crunchyroll announced on Tuesday that its English dub for the Estab-Life: Great Escape original anime project by Goro Taniguchi will debut with the first episode on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. EDT. The dub's cast, under ADR Director Jeremy Inman, ADR engineer Jeremy Woods, ADR script writer Jarrod Greene, and ADR mix engineer William Dewell, includes:     Julie Shields as Equa   Alexis Tipton as Feles   Sarah Wiedenheft as Martes   Cris George as Ulula   Anthony Bowling as Alga   Molly Searcy   Lucía Lobosvilla   Dusty Feeney   Kelsey Maher   Rachel Thompson   Kyle Phillips   Jeff Johnson   Rex Underwood   Jim Foronda   Larry Brantley    The first four episodes of the show began streaming on the FOD service in Japan on March 1. The show then premiered on television on April 6 on the +Ultra anime programming block on Fuji TV and its affiliates, and Crunchyroll streams the anime outside Asia.    The anime stars:     Tomomi Mineuchi as Equa, the Nigashiya leader   Rie Takahashi as Feles, the superbly athletic, quick-firing ""gun wizard""  Maria Naganawa as Martes, a slime-human  Sho Hayami as Alga, an old fogey of an AI robot  Shinichiro Miki as Ulula, a wolfman who says nothing but ""wan"" (woof)   The project will have a television anime, smartphone game, and anime film, which have the themes of ""escape,"" ""records,"" and ""variant,"" respectively. (The English subtitle for Estab Life is ""Establishment in Life."")    The story is set in the distant future when the world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence.    Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Taniguchi is credited for the original concept and creative supervision of the Estab-Life: Great Escape television anime, and SSF is credited with the original story. Hiroyuki Hashimoto (Is the order a rabbit?, Slow Start) is directing the anime at Polygon Pictures, and Shoji Gatoh (Full Metal Panic!, Hyou-ka, Cop Craft) is supervising and writing the scripts.

Yoshiaki Fujisawa (No Game, No Life Zero, A Place Further Than the Universe, Revue Starlight) is composing the music. Slow Curve developed and produced the project.

News Doraemon: Nobita's Little Star Wars 2021 Film Opens in Vietnam on May 27   posted on 2022-04-22 17:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film opened in Japan on March 4 after yearlong COVID-19 delay    Vietnamese film distributor Lotte Cinema announced on Wednesday that it will screen the Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 anime film in Vietnam beginning on May 27.    The film opened in Japan on March 4 after a yearlong delay due to COVID-19. It ranked at #1 in its opening weekend, and sold 350,000 tickets for 440 million yen (about US$3.81 million) in its first three days.    Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 is the 41st film in the Doraemon franchise. The film is a remake of the 1985 Doraemon film of the same title.    Susumu Yamaguchi — a key animator on many previous Doraemon movies, unit director of Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration, and the director of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE — directed the new film. Dai Sato (Eureka Seven, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Listeners) penned the script. Official HiGE DANdism created the theme song ""Universe"" specifically for the film. Sibling folk duo Billy BanBan performed the insert song ""Kokoro Arigatō"" (Thank You for the Heart). Shirogumi, the 3D CG studio behind the production of the Stand By Me Doraemon films, handled the CG for the spaceships in the film.

News Doraemon: Nobita's Little Star Wars 2021 Film Opens in Vietnam on May 27   posted on 2022-04-22 17:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film opened in Japan on March 4 after yearlong COVID-19 delay    Vietnamese film distributor Lotte Cinema announced on Wednesday that it will screen the Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 anime film in Vietnam beginning on May 27.    The film opened in Japan on March 4 after a yearlong delay due to COVID-19. It ranked at #1 in its opening weekend, and sold 350,000 tickets for 440 million yen (about US$3.81 million) in its first three days.    Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 is the 41st film in the Doraemon franchise. The film is a remake of the 1985 Doraemon film of the same title.    Susumu Yamaguchi — a key animator on many previous Doraemon movies, unit director of Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration, and the director of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE — directed the new film. Dai Sato (Eureka Seven, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Listeners) penned the script. Official HiGE DANdism created the theme song ""Universe"" specifically for the film. Sibling folk duo Billy BanBan performed the insert song ""Kokoro Arigatō"" (Thank You for the Heart). Shirogumi, the 3D CG studio behind the production of the Stand By Me Doraemon films, handled the CG for the spaceships in the film.

I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Like I get they seem to be going through stuff and she's honestly just there to baby sit them and be their go-pher. But they are almost always actively terrible people not only to her but everyone else   I mean you can have bad boy or troubled leads totally, but they do like nothing to make these two just hateful and annoyed.

If Hiyori is ""Cinderella"" they're basically meant to be her wicked steps sister's, you not finding them appealing is pretty much on purpose.

I love the source material, I'm loving seeing where the anime is taking the plot, and I can't wait to see what comes next! We all should love the precious potato eyebrow girl.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.

I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.     I don't want to say that you're supposed to hate them, though only because they have their own storylines separate from Hiyori and they're definitely not solely supposed to be disliked.

I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Like I get they seem to be going through stuff and she's honestly just there to baby sit them and be their go-pher. But they are almost always actively terrible people not only to her but everyone else   I mean you can have bad boy or troubled leads totally, but they do like nothing to make these two just hateful and annoyed.

I love the source material, I'm loving seeing where the anime is taking the plot, and I can't wait to see what comes next! We all should love the precious potato eyebrow girl.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.     I don't want to say that you're supposed to hate them, though only because they have their own storylines separate from Hiyori and they're definitely not solely supposed to be disliked.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.      Back to top                  thadec    Joined: 02 Apr 2022 		    Posts: 35       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 2:00 pm            It is clear that Iino likes Ishigami. Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

She has nothing to lose by being herself.            Whether your family is elite or not, the consequences being disowned or even simply shunned by your family are far from irrelevant. It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.      Back to top                  thadec    Joined: 02 Apr 2022 		    Posts: 35       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 2:00 pm            It is clear that Iino likes Ishigami. Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.      Back to top                  thadec    Joined: 02 Apr 2022 		    Posts: 35       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 2:00 pm            It is clear that Iino likes Ishigami. Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

She has nothing to lose by being herself.            Whether your family is elite or not, the consequences being disowned or even simply shunned by your family are far from irrelevant. It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.
