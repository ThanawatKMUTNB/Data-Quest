And ironically enough, the second time they rescued a license from Netflix following a commercially unsuccessful Dreamworks adaptation of an old show (they currently have a live-action She-Ra in the pipeline that people expect to essentially be Xena, Warrior Princess).   Speaking of, with Dreamworks not involved in the production in any way, this seems to confirm fully that the script will be an adaptation of the 80s series, not the unsuccessful reboot.  Then again, if it was based on the reboot, the bidding war likely wouldn’t have been so heated.

Doesn’t Dreamworks own the US rights to Voltron as a whole (since they own World Events Productions)? I’m sure they’ll at least be a producing partner.

I’m sure they’ll at least be a producing partner.            No they do not.  What they owned what Classic Media, which had the distribution rights to a bunch of old WEP and Filmation shows.  They leveraged that to negotiate for the rights to the Voltron franchise as a whole and made what ended up being VLD.  While those rights could have been held longer, Dreamworks/Universal willingly let them expire when they failed to produce a movie in terms of the original contract.  So the rights reverted to WEP TV Inc, the master licensor, who helped kick off the bidding war.   However, Dreamworks does own all the original concepts made strictly for VLD, character designs, Shiro, etc.  So WEP can’t use those without Dreamworks’ permission, but again, given the commercial failure of VLD, coupled with WEP President Bob Koplar’s own comments about moving on from VLD (specifically at VoltCon 2020 when he said he was done with Universal, claiming they, and I quote “Didn’t get Voltron”), he won’t be using them even if he could.

Amazon also doesn't exactly have the best track record in terms of its adaptations remaining faithful to and respectful of their source material.  I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but until some plot and trailers are revealed my expectations for this one are going to be low.

And ironically enough, the second time they rescued a license from Netflix following a commercially unsuccessful Dreamworks adaptation of an old show (they currently have a live-action She-Ra in the pipeline that people expect to essentially be Xena, Warrior Princess).   Speaking of, with Dreamworks not involved in the production in any way, this seems to confirm fully that the script will be an adaptation of the 80s series, not the unsuccessful reboot.  Then again, if it was based on the reboot, the bidding war likely wouldn’t have been so heated.

Doesn’t Dreamworks own the US rights to Voltron as a whole (since they own World Events Productions)? I’m sure they’ll at least be a producing partner.

They leveraged that to negotiate for the rights to the Voltron franchise as a whole and made what ended up being VLD.  While those rights could have been held longer, Dreamworks/Universal willingly let them expire when they failed to produce a movie in terms of the original contract.  So the rights reverted to WEP TV Inc, the master licensor, who helped kick off the bidding war.   However, Dreamworks does own all the original concepts made strictly for VLD, character designs, Shiro, etc.  So WEP can’t use those without Dreamworks’ permission, but again, given the commercial failure of VLD, coupled with WEP President Bob Koplar’s own comments about moving on from VLD (specifically at VoltCon 2020 when he said he was done with Universal, claiming they, and I quote “Didn’t get Voltron”), he won’t be using them even if he could.

Amazon also doesn't exactly have the best track record in terms of its adaptations remaining faithful to and respectful of their source material.  I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but until some plot and trailers are revealed my expectations for this one are going to be low.

Speaking of, with Dreamworks not involved in the production in any way, this seems to confirm fully that the script will be an adaptation of the 80s series, not the unsuccessful reboot.

Doesn’t Dreamworks own the US rights to Voltron as a whole (since they own World Events Productions)? I’m sure they’ll at least be a producing partner.

I’m sure they’ll at least be a producing partner.            No they do not.  What they owned what Classic Media, which had the distribution rights to a bunch of old WEP and Filmation shows.  They leveraged that to negotiate for the rights to the Voltron franchise as a whole and made what ended up being VLD.  While those rights could have been held longer, Dreamworks/Universal willingly let them expire when they failed to produce a movie in terms of the original contract.  So the rights reverted to WEP TV Inc, the master licensor, who helped kick off the bidding war.   However, Dreamworks does own all the original concepts made strictly for VLD, character designs, Shiro, etc.  So WEP can’t use those without Dreamworks’ permission, but again, given the commercial failure of VLD, coupled with WEP President Bob Koplar’s own comments about moving on from VLD (specifically at VoltCon 2020 when he said he was done with Universal, claiming they, and I quote “Didn’t get Voltron”), he won’t be using them even if he could.

Amazon also doesn't exactly have the best track record in terms of its adaptations remaining faithful to and respectful of their source material.  I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but until some plot and trailers are revealed my expectations for this one are going to be low.

They leveraged that to negotiate for the rights to the Voltron franchise as a whole and made what ended up being VLD.  While those rights could have been held longer, Dreamworks/Universal willingly let them expire when they failed to produce a movie in terms of the original contract.  So the rights reverted to WEP TV Inc, the master licensor, who helped kick off the bidding war.   However, Dreamworks does own all the original concepts made strictly for VLD, character designs, Shiro, etc.  So WEP can’t use those without Dreamworks’ permission, but again, given the commercial failure of VLD, coupled with WEP President Bob Koplar’s own comments about moving on from VLD (specifically at VoltCon 2020 when he said he was done with Universal, claiming they, and I quote “Didn’t get Voltron”), he won’t be using them even if he could.

Amazon also doesn't exactly have the best track record in terms of its adaptations remaining faithful to and respectful of their source material.  I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but until some plot and trailers are revealed my expectations for this one are going to be low.

They leveraged that to negotiate for the rights to the Voltron franchise as a whole and made what ended up being VLD.  While those rights could have been held longer, Dreamworks/Universal willingly let them expire when they failed to produce a movie in terms of the original contract.

However, Dreamworks does own all the original concepts made strictly for VLD, character designs, Shiro, etc.  So WEP can’t use those without Dreamworks’ permission, but again, given the commercial failure of VLD, coupled with WEP President Bob Koplar’s own comments about moving on from VLD (specifically at VoltCon 2020 when he said he was done with Universal, claiming they, and I quote “Didn’t get Voltron”), he won’t be using them even if he could.

So the rights reverted to WEP TV Inc, the master licensor, who helped kick off the bidding war.   However, Dreamworks does own all the original concepts made strictly for VLD, character designs, Shiro, etc.  So WEP can’t use those without Dreamworks’ permission, but again, given the commercial failure of VLD, coupled with WEP President Bob Koplar’s own comments about moving on from VLD (specifically at VoltCon 2020 when he said he was done with Universal, claiming they, and I quote “Didn’t get Voltron”), he won’t be using them even if he could.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey.

Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world.

I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say.

Katsuhiko Chiba (Rune Soldier, Baby Steps, Tiger Mask W) is supervising the series' scripts. Emiko Miyamoto (Maho Girls Precure!) is designing the characters. Ayaka Fujii (Studio Pablo) is the art director. Yuki Hayashi is composing the music. Aya Mori is in charge of color design. Dragon Quest series director Yuji Horii is credited for supervising the original manga. Toei Animation is producing the anime, which is a hybrid of CG and 2D animation.

I'm always amazed that it hasn't collapsed in on itself yet. The Danganronpa comparison is apt, because it becomes increasingly clear as the series goes on that Rentaro is basically a Super High-School Level Boyfriend.   Mind you, the pace of girlfriend acquisition has slowed down from these first couple volumes. These days it's maintained a rate of about one girlfriend every six chapters, so at the current pace it'll take till around chapter 580 to hit 100.   You know, for a while I've wished someone would write a fanfic for this manga using the soulmark premise. I'm envisioning, like, a 10x10 grid of dots, plus one more in the very center for Rentaro, and everyone's missing the dot referencing themself.

I'd been going through it comparing the translation to the fan translation and it's really good!   The manga works so well because Rentarou isn't a potato but an aggressively kind and loving guy. Plus he has great eyebrows.   It's such an over the top series, everyone is so much fun and it breaks the fourth wall so much I don't think there's a wall there to break anymore.   I love the art so much, Nozawa has such great designs AND comical capabilities.    anyway basically please read 100gf      Back to top                  Past    Joined: 14 Feb 2006 		    Posts: 3458 		    Location: Guangzhou, CH Pronouns: she/her 		        Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 10:00 pm            Both of the girls on the cover have Sakura hair.

Rentarou is such a 100/10 WOULD DATE guy that this manga really works for me. He is just soooo nice and adorable that I actually won't mind sharing him with other women because everyone could use a man this nice in their lives.   The girls are also huge plus. They are so cute in their own ways that the harem dynamic just works.

That phrase is more common than we realize to explain the enjoyability of a certain title when the story itself is not the catch.  A situation with a large number of potential lovers clamoring for 1 MC has always been too obscenely far removed from any real-life experience I can recall or would ever think is remotely possible.  Its much more funny to watch the MC fail and stumble and revel in my mostly lonely life (not anymore though).

""Will it continue?"" ""Can it hit the mark?""     For anyone curious the manga is nearly at 100 chapters (95, I believe) and Rentarou has 18 gfs so far.  And so far, they are all pretty unique.   And my favorite page of this manga so far, is chap 35, the last page (18).

Highly worth it! I enjoyed the heck out of both volumes. It somehow manages to tell a trope-filled harem story while being perfectly aware that it IS a trope-filled harem story and gets away with it in ways it has no business doing. The girls are cute (especially girlfriends #1 and 2), the MC likable, and I can't wait to read the rest.    Also, the running gag about the MC getting poked in the right eye repeatedly in the one chapter had me laughing out loud every time. Great comedic timing by the manga-ka.

I'm always amazed that it hasn't collapsed in on itself yet. The Danganronpa comparison is apt, because it becomes increasingly clear as the series goes on that Rentaro is basically a Super High-School Level Boyfriend.   Mind you, the pace of girlfriend acquisition has slowed down from these first couple volumes. These days it's maintained a rate of about one girlfriend every six chapters, so at the current pace it'll take till around chapter 580 to hit 100.   You know, for a while I've wished someone would write a fanfic for this manga using the soulmark premise. I'm envisioning, like, a 10x10 grid of dots, plus one more in the very center for Rentaro, and everyone's missing the dot referencing themself.

I'd been going through it comparing the translation to the fan translation and it's really good!   The manga works so well because Rentarou isn't a potato but an aggressively kind and loving guy. Plus he has great eyebrows.   It's such an over the top series, everyone is so much fun and it breaks the fourth wall so much I don't think there's a wall there to break anymore.   I love the art so much, Nozawa has such great designs AND comical capabilities.    anyway basically please read 100gf      Back to top                  Past    Joined: 14 Feb 2006 		    Posts: 3458 		    Location: Guangzhou, CH Pronouns: she/her 		        Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 10:00 pm            Both of the girls on the cover have Sakura hair.

Rentarou is such a 100/10 WOULD DATE guy that this manga really works for me. He is just soooo nice and adorable that I actually won't mind sharing him with other women because everyone could use a man this nice in their lives.   The girls are also huge plus. They are so cute in their own ways that the harem dynamic just works.

That phrase is more common than we realize to explain the enjoyability of a certain title when the story itself is not the catch.  A situation with a large number of potential lovers clamoring for 1 MC has always been too obscenely far removed from any real-life experience I can recall or would ever think is remotely possible.  Its much more funny to watch the MC fail and stumble and revel in my mostly lonely life (not anymore though).

""Will it continue?"" ""Can it hit the mark?""     For anyone curious the manga is nearly at 100 chapters (95, I believe) and Rentarou has 18 gfs so far.  And so far, they are all pretty unique.   And my favorite page of this manga so far, is chap 35, the last page (18).

Highly worth it! I enjoyed the heck out of both volumes. It somehow manages to tell a trope-filled harem story while being perfectly aware that it IS a trope-filled harem story and gets away with it in ways it has no business doing. The girls are cute (especially girlfriends #1 and 2), the MC likable, and I can't wait to read the rest.    Also, the running gag about the MC getting poked in the right eye repeatedly in the one chapter had me laughing out loud every time. Great comedic timing by the manga-ka.

I'm always amazed that it hasn't collapsed in on itself yet. The Danganronpa comparison is apt, because it becomes increasingly clear as the series goes on that Rentaro is basically a Super High-School Level Boyfriend.   Mind you, the pace of girlfriend acquisition has slowed down from these first couple volumes. These days it's maintained a rate of about one girlfriend every six chapters, so at the current pace it'll take till around chapter 580 to hit 100.   You know, for a while I've wished someone would write a fanfic for this manga using the soulmark premise. I'm envisioning, like, a 10x10 grid of dots, plus one more in the very center for Rentaro, and everyone's missing the dot referencing themself.

I'd been going through it comparing the translation to the fan translation and it's really good!   The manga works so well because Rentarou isn't a potato but an aggressively kind and loving guy. Plus he has great eyebrows.   It's such an over the top series, everyone is so much fun and it breaks the fourth wall so much I don't think there's a wall there to break anymore.   I love the art so much, Nozawa has such great designs AND comical capabilities.    anyway basically please read 100gf      Back to top                  Past    Joined: 14 Feb 2006 		    Posts: 3458 		    Location: Guangzhou, CH Pronouns: she/her 		        Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 10:00 pm            Both of the girls on the cover have Sakura hair.

Rentarou is such a 100/10 WOULD DATE guy that this manga really works for me. He is just soooo nice and adorable that I actually won't mind sharing him with other women because everyone could use a man this nice in their lives.   The girls are also huge plus. They are so cute in their own ways that the harem dynamic just works.

That phrase is more common than we realize to explain the enjoyability of a certain title when the story itself is not the catch.  A situation with a large number of potential lovers clamoring for 1 MC has always been too obscenely far removed from any real-life experience I can recall or would ever think is remotely possible.  Its much more funny to watch the MC fail and stumble and revel in my mostly lonely life (not anymore though).

""Will it continue?"" ""Can it hit the mark?""     For anyone curious the manga is nearly at 100 chapters (95, I believe) and Rentarou has 18 gfs so far.  And so far, they are all pretty unique.   And my favorite page of this manga so far, is chap 35, the last page (18).

Highly worth it! I enjoyed the heck out of both volumes. It somehow manages to tell a trope-filled harem story while being perfectly aware that it IS a trope-filled harem story and gets away with it in ways it has no business doing. The girls are cute (especially girlfriends #1 and 2), the MC likable, and I can't wait to read the rest.    Also, the running gag about the MC getting poked in the right eye repeatedly in the one chapter had me laughing out loud every time. Great comedic timing by the manga-ka.

I'm always amazed that it hasn't collapsed in on itself yet. The Danganronpa comparison is apt, because it becomes increasingly clear as the series goes on that Rentaro is basically a Super High-School Level Boyfriend.   Mind you, the pace of girlfriend acquisition has slowed down from these first couple volumes. These days it's maintained a rate of about one girlfriend every six chapters, so at the current pace it'll take till around chapter 580 to hit 100.   You know, for a while I've wished someone would write a fanfic for this manga using the soulmark premise. I'm envisioning, like, a 10x10 grid of dots, plus one more in the very center for Rentaro, and everyone's missing the dot referencing themself.

I'd been going through it comparing the translation to the fan translation and it's really good!   The manga works so well because Rentarou isn't a potato but an aggressively kind and loving guy. Plus he has great eyebrows.   It's such an over the top series, everyone is so much fun and it breaks the fourth wall so much I don't think there's a wall there to break anymore.   I love the art so much, Nozawa has such great designs AND comical capabilities.    anyway basically please read 100gf      Back to top                  Past    Joined: 14 Feb 2006 		    Posts: 3458 		    Location: Guangzhou, CH Pronouns: she/her 		        Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 10:00 pm            Both of the girls on the cover have Sakura hair.

Rentarou is such a 100/10 WOULD DATE guy that this manga really works for me. He is just soooo nice and adorable that I actually won't mind sharing him with other women because everyone could use a man this nice in their lives.   The girls are also huge plus. They are so cute in their own ways that the harem dynamic just works.

That phrase is more common than we realize to explain the enjoyability of a certain title when the story itself is not the catch.  A situation with a large number of potential lovers clamoring for 1 MC has always been too obscenely far removed from any real-life experience I can recall or would ever think is remotely possible.  Its much more funny to watch the MC fail and stumble and revel in my mostly lonely life (not anymore though).

""Will it continue?"" ""Can it hit the mark?""     For anyone curious the manga is nearly at 100 chapters (95, I believe) and Rentarou has 18 gfs so far.  And so far, they are all pretty unique.   And my favorite page of this manga so far, is chap 35, the last page (18).

This review has convinced me that it's actually pretty genuine, I'll have to actually check it out at some point      Back to top                  Akcoll99    Joined: 28 Feb 2011 		    Posts: 97       Posted: Fri Apr 22, 2022 9:40 pm            I ran by my local bookstore after reading this review and bought the first two volumes. Highly worth it! I enjoyed the heck out of both volumes. It somehow manages to tell a trope-filled harem story while being perfectly aware that it IS a trope-filled harem story and gets away with it in ways it has no business doing. The girls are cute (especially girlfriends #1 and 2), the MC likable, and I can't wait to read the rest.    Also, the running gag about the MC getting poked in the right eye repeatedly in the one chapter had me laughing out loud every time. Great comedic timing by the manga-ka.

Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Episodes 1-3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?

Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Episodes 1-3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?

Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Episodes 1-3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?

Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred.

Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.

Community score: 4.2           (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for  The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2-3 portion of the review is completely new.)    Episode 1:   As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.    Rating:                Episode 2-3:  After introducing us to its world and its protagonist Leon, the second and third episodes of Trapped in a Dating Sim are about developing Olivia, Marie, and Angelica.    Oliva is the player character for Alto Liebe. She's literally tailor-made to snatch the hearts of the six romantic leads. What's interesting is that Leon found her to be conniving and shrewd while he was playing as her. This is a reflection of himself, as he was playing with the express purpose of wooing one man or another and had no real feelings for any of them. However, the actual Olivia is just as the game's creators intended: she is the stereotypical too-kind-for-her-own-good country girl who has been thrown into high society. The problem is that she is also designed to pure and vulnerable—someone who the male leads would step in to protect—but with the plot of the game heavily derailed, no one has been coming to her rescue. As such, she has been relentlessly bullied for no real reason. Leon has (somewhat reluctantly) stepped in to help her escape her pointless torment but he has the same issue that many reincarnated-in-a-game-world protagonists suffer from: he has trouble separating the video game character from the actual person. He sees Olivia as the literal center of this world and that everything is fated to go her way, even when this is clearly not the case.    While there's no doubt Leon has been exploiting the game's plot for his own benefit (such as getting end game items early for himself), his actions have yet to have any real effect on Alto Liebe's core story. The same cannot be said for Marie's actions, however. As another reincarnator with memories of the game, she uses her knowledge to supplant Olivia as the protagonist and reap the benefits. If Leon has issues seeing the inhabitants of Holfort Kingdom as real people, Marie straight up sees the whole world as her plaything. Those vying for her heart aren't people, but simply things to be obtained and used. She doesn't care about them beyond their looks and what they can do for her. She is simply going through the motions to rope them in. However, her impatience may prove to be her downfall. Rather than letting the romance events take place naturally over time, she has been rushing things towards the harem ending she so clearly desires.    Because of this, Angelica, the “villainess” of the story, hasn't actually done anything worthy of the designation. While some of her minions have been provoked into bullying Marie without her knowledge or consent, she herself has done little beyond speaking out about the fact that the prince is ignoring the propriety of his station by publicly flirting with Marie. The worst thing she has done is simply push Marie aside in a fit of worry when the prince is injured.    As such, Angelica is a truly tragic character. After spending her life preparing to rule the kingdom and support her royal partner in all things, she now finds her fiancé flaunting his new relationship—going so far as to break off their engagement publicly and explain he is fine being part of Marie's harem. Seeing things from Angelica's point of view, it's easy to hate the prince and his pretty boy friends, who have all become so caught up in their romance that they've thrown both political and ethical considerations to the wind. They're assholes who would stoop to publicly shaming a woman who has done nothing wrong.    And that's why it feels so cathartic when Leon turns his own asshole-ish nature up to 11. Sure, a part of him clearly feels sorry for Angelica for being forced into her villainess role, but what drove him to step forward and become Angelica's champion isn't empathy, but hatred. If the prince and his fellow romantic leads were bad enough as characters in a game, as real people with agency he hates them even more (not to mention the obvious jealousy stemming from the fact that they alone seem unaffected by the world's ultra-misandric nature.) And even worse than them is Marie who has condemned Olivia to a cycle of meaningless torment for her own benefit, playing with the fate of the world without considering the potential consequences of her actions.    Leon is quite clearly at his limit. With the game's story so off track and his own chances of finding a nice girl and fading into the background seemingly non-existent, why not take a page out of Marie's book and go for full self-satisfaction—consequences be damned? Now all that's left is to revel in the continuing catharsis as Leon sets out to curbstomp them with his end-game mecha next episode.
