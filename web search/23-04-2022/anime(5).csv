SEGA has a lot of IPs which they never brought back, I'd like to see a remake of the first four Phantasy Star games.  Now, I've heard that these reboots are part of a ""Super Game"" project that SEGA of Japan has mentioned a couple of years ago, but it seems like they're are aiming for the Fortnite crowd and that they're going to be free-to-play with microtransactions. Not to mention there were some rumors that SEGA of Japan is interested in the NFT business. That doesn't sound so good      Back to top                  MarshalBanana    Joined: 31 Aug 2014 		    Posts: 4550       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 2:18 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Never played Jet Set Radio but I did play Crazy Taxi in the arcades.

SEGA has a lot of IPs which they never brought back, I'd like to see a remake of the first four Phantasy Star games.  Now, I've heard that these reboots are part of a ""Super Game"" project that SEGA of Japan has mentioned a couple of years ago, but it seems like they're are aiming for the Fortnite crowd and that they're going to be free-to-play with microtransactions. Not to mention there were some rumors that SEGA of Japan is interested in the NFT business. That doesn't sound so good      Back to top                  MarshalBanana    Joined: 31 Aug 2014 		    Posts: 4550       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 2:18 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Never played Jet Set Radio but I did play Crazy Taxi in the arcades.

Now, I've heard that these reboots are part of a ""Super Game"" project that SEGA of Japan has mentioned a couple of years ago, but it seems like they're are aiming for the Fortnite crowd and that they're going to be free-to-play with microtransactions. Not to mention there were some rumors that SEGA of Japan is interested in the NFT business.

SEGA has a lot of IPs which they never brought back, I'd like to see a remake of the first four Phantasy Star games.  Now, I've heard that these reboots are part of a ""Super Game"" project that SEGA of Japan has mentioned a couple of years ago, but it seems like they're are aiming for the Fortnite crowd and that they're going to be free-to-play with microtransactions. Not to mention there were some rumors that SEGA of Japan is interested in the NFT business. That doesn't sound so good      Back to top                  MarshalBanana    Joined: 31 Aug 2014 		    Posts: 4550       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 2:18 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Never played Jet Set Radio but I did play Crazy Taxi in the arcades.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3957       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 1:20 pm            So far I think Doga Kobo is doing an amazing job of adapting the manga. The animation, the direction, the VA work, are all incredibly on-point and just as adorable. Saori Onishi is great as Shikimori.   I'm actually kind of surprised at the negative reception I've seen online in other circles. I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

If there's one thing to complain about, it would be progress for the main couple, spoiler[at 144 chapters, a kiss on the cheek is about the farthest they've gone yet...]      Back to top                  pharmboy23    Joined: 05 Oct 2018 		    Posts: 194       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 1:48 pm            Hachimitsu definitely turns out to be a scene stealer and I actually DO think that the adaptation is moving faster than the manga, possibly to its detriment?   However, the first volume of the manga was so boring that I had to have friends who stuck with it saying how good it was to go back to it and now it’s one of my faves. This is a story about a relationship between two people very much in love and that is it. That’s the story. And, honestly, the mild bumps in the road are fine but it doesn’t need high drama   This is a love for the sake of love story and it’s absolutely perfect that way, for my money.

I think Inuzuka being nice!Bakguo and Hachimitsu being such a mood stand out pretty well.          I think the show is running into a perception issue. It was being hyped up as the next big rom-com. Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull.

It looks very pretty. The opening theme in particular. Some of the supporting characters are pretty fun, especially best girl Hachimitsu. And there's definitely some dramatic intrigue there that I trust the show will treat with a respectful amount of seriousness. But it doesn't really feel like anything is happening, even in the context of a slice-of-life. The atmosphere of its script is more than a little bland. Shikimori's ""coolness"" is too inconsistent for what my expectations of them were. Izumi's unfortunate luck is even moreso, and actually wore down on me faster than it did in Tenchi Muyo! GXP when it was Seina's gimmick. In the second episode, it got way too predictable to be worthy of even a sensible chuckle, and aggravating enough that I'm convinced half of it is the fault of Izumi being too stupid to remember that he was, to quote every synopsis of Ah! My Goddess I've come across online, ""born under an unlucky star"". He's the kind of stupid that ableists use to justify why some children should be left behind. I won't be surprised if I end up hating him enough that it breaks me free of the curse I've had since ""Stanley's Cup"" of me liking every protagonist I come across, even the incorrigible ones. I also won't be surprised if it improves enough by the halfway point that I can say, ""it's pretty good"".

Two votes. It's that interplay that tells you ""hey, these people really like each other and we think that's super rad."" I know there are other reasons to like Spice & Wolf, but the two main characters just talking to each other pushes the series to another level of excellence.   You love to see it.

It was being hyped up as the next big rom-com. Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull. Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.           I feel like it's very similar to Tonikawa in terms of quickly establishing the couple and focusing more on their drama-free romance and growing relationship with some supporting cast...and I'd say Shikimori is kind of in the same cool beauty vein as Tsukasa, they just emphasize it more, but I think that's to the shows' benefit. Although I think a lot of people found Nasa maybe more palatable than Izumi is at a first glance.    I definitely think there's a lot of competition this season...Kaguya season 3, Love after World Domination, Aharen-san, Science Fell in Love, and I guess even DAL is kind of romcom-ish amidst all the Battle Harem antics. But I think Shikimori does what it's base appeal is very well, and I enjoy watching it.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3957       Posted: Tue Apr 19, 2022 1:20 pm            So far I think Doga Kobo is doing an amazing job of adapting the manga. The animation, the direction, the VA work, are all incredibly on-point and just as adorable. Saori Onishi is great as Shikimori.   I'm actually kind of surprised at the negative reception I've seen online in other circles. I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

However, the first volume of the manga was so boring that I had to have friends who stuck with it saying how good it was to go back to it and now it’s one of my faves. This is a story about a relationship between two people very much in love and that is it. That’s the story. And, honestly, the mild bumps in the road are fine but it doesn’t need high drama   This is a love for the sake of love story and it’s absolutely perfect that way, for my money.

I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

I think Inuzuka being nice!Bakguo and Hachimitsu being such a mood stand out pretty well.          I think the show is running into a perception issue. It was being hyped up as the next big rom-com. Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull. Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.

It looks very pretty. The opening theme in particular. Some of the supporting characters are pretty fun, especially best girl Hachimitsu. And there's definitely some dramatic intrigue there that I trust the show will treat with a respectful amount of seriousness. But it doesn't really feel like anything is happening, even in the context of a slice-of-life. The atmosphere of its script is more than a little bland. Shikimori's ""coolness"" is too inconsistent for what my expectations of them were. Izumi's unfortunate luck is even moreso, and actually wore down on me faster than it did in Tenchi Muyo! GXP when it was Seina's gimmick. In the second episode, it got way too predictable to be worthy of even a sensible chuckle, and aggravating enough that I'm convinced half of it is the fault of Izumi being too stupid to remember that he was, to quote every synopsis of Ah! My Goddess I've come across online, ""born under an unlucky star"". He's the kind of stupid that ableists use to justify why some children should be left behind. I won't be surprised if I end up hating him enough that it breaks me free of the curse I've had since ""Stanley's Cup"" of me liking every protagonist I come across, even the incorrigible ones. I also won't be surprised if it improves enough by the halfway point that I can say, ""it's pretty good"".

Two votes. It's that interplay that tells you ""hey, these people really like each other and we think that's super rad."" I know there are other reasons to like Spice & Wolf, but the two main characters just talking to each other pushes the series to another level of excellence.   You love to see it.

I feel like it's very similar to Tonikawa in terms of quickly establishing the couple and focusing more on their drama-free romance and growing relationship with some supporting cast...and I'd say Shikimori is kind of in the same cool beauty vein as Tsukasa, they just emphasize it more, but I think that's to the shows' benefit. Although I think a lot of people found Nasa maybe more palatable than Izumi is at a first glance.    I definitely think there's a lot of competition this season...Kaguya season 3, Love after World Domination, Aharen-san, Science Fell in Love, and I guess even DAL is kind of romcom-ish amidst all the Battle Harem antics. But I think Shikimori does what it's base appeal is very well, and I enjoy watching it.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.

I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.2            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.2            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.2            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

News xxxHOLiC: Rei Manga's Return Slated for Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-21 16:09 UTC-8 by Egan Loo           The print edition of the Kōshiki Comic Guide xxxHOLiC: Rei (Official Comic Guide  xxxHOLiC: Rei) book announced on Wednesday that the return of manga creator circle CLAMP's xxxHOLiC: Rei manga series is slated for next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    In an interview that Kadokawa had published in the May issue of Da Vinci magazine on April 6, CLAMP had stated that the group was still planning to continue their xxxHOLiC: Rei manga, which is currently on hiatus. CLAMP added that while they could not say (at that time) when the manga would continue, they always thought of xxxHOLiC as a work that exists ""in the background"" of other CLAMP works, and that they have been trying to write the story as the center of all interconnected CLAMP works in mind.   xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga in CLAMP's xxxHOLiC series, and it launched in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in 2013 after an initial delay. The series went on hiatus in July 2014 and returned in April 2015. The manga has since been serialized irregularly. The manga last published chapters from June 2016 to March 2017. Kodansha released the manga's third compiled book volume in October 2016.    The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects. The manga is inspiring an upcoming live-action film that will open on April 29.

News xxxHOLiC: Rei Manga's Return Slated for Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-21 16:09 UTC-8 by Egan Loo           The print edition of the Kōshiki Comic Guide xxxHOLiC: Rei (Official Comic Guide  xxxHOLiC: Rei) book announced on Wednesday that the return of manga creator circle CLAMP's xxxHOLiC: Rei manga series is slated for next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    In an interview that Kadokawa had published in the May issue of Da Vinci magazine on April 6, CLAMP had stated that the group was still planning to continue their xxxHOLiC: Rei manga, which is currently on hiatus. CLAMP added that while they could not say (at that time) when the manga would continue, they always thought of xxxHOLiC as a work that exists ""in the background"" of other CLAMP works, and that they have been trying to write the story as the center of all interconnected CLAMP works in mind.   xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga in CLAMP's xxxHOLiC series, and it launched in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in 2013 after an initial delay. The series went on hiatus in July 2014 and returned in April 2015. The manga has since been serialized irregularly. The manga last published chapters from June 2016 to March 2017. Kodansha released the manga's third compiled book volume in October 2016.    The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects. The manga is inspiring an upcoming live-action film that will open on April 29.

News xxxHOLiC: Rei Manga's Return Slated for Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-21 16:09 UTC-8 by Egan Loo           The print edition of the Kōshiki Comic Guide xxxHOLiC: Rei (Official Comic Guide  xxxHOLiC: Rei) book announced on Wednesday that the return of manga creator circle CLAMP's xxxHOLiC: Rei manga series is slated for next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    In an interview that Kadokawa had published in the May issue of Da Vinci magazine on April 6, CLAMP had stated that the group was still planning to continue their xxxHOLiC: Rei manga, which is currently on hiatus. CLAMP added that while they could not say (at that time) when the manga would continue, they always thought of xxxHOLiC as a work that exists ""in the background"" of other CLAMP works, and that they have been trying to write the story as the center of all interconnected CLAMP works in mind.   xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga in CLAMP's xxxHOLiC series, and it launched in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in 2013 after an initial delay. The series went on hiatus in July 2014 and returned in April 2015. The manga has since been serialized irregularly. The manga last published chapters from June 2016 to March 2017. Kodansha released the manga's third compiled book volume in October 2016.    The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects. The manga is inspiring an upcoming live-action film that will open on April 29.

Ninja Slayer is a Japanese light novel series, originally posted in pieces on Twitter at @NJ_SLYR.

When I started this column I wondered to myself “I wonder when I'll order Naruto.” Well, it's been four years since then and here we are.

This time from Steins;Gate! And it has proper lab slippers! ―  Figma Rintarou Okabe Series: Steins;Gate Maker: GSC Price: ~$48 I've found that Steins;Gate is one of those “you haven't watched Steins;Gate?!” series, so I'm going to come out of the gate and say I haven't seen Steins;Gate. That being said, it's pretty popular, Galvion got delayed... so we bought a figma off the shelf.

But who could resist Tomoko? ―  Nendoroid Tomoko Kuroki Maker: Good Smile Company Series: Watamote Price: $48 Now we just did a Nendoroid here at Astro Toy, and I realize this might be redundant... but it's alright, it's Watamote.

Did you manage to see Madoka 3 in its little theatrical run a few weeks back? I'm going to break my rule and talk about what I thought of it.

Nendoroid Miku 2.0 is #300 in that line.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma volume 1 game launched on September 2015.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma volume 1 game launched on September 2015.

Game Review   by Todd Ciolek, Apr 23rd 2022       Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Nintendo Switch                     Description:             Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.      Review:         Description:        Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.     Review:            There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters, better animation, and smoother play than any 8-bit system could manage. Are they neo-retro? Noveau 8-bit? Nostalgia traps? Whatever the movement might be called, Gotta Protectors was there at the start, with Protect Me Knight in 2010 and Gotta Protectors in 2016. And now Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness arrives on the Switch so thick with retro attachment that the initial screen mimics a fuzzy TV signal, while the game itself wastes few screens before its princess protagonist squeals that her castle is moving ""faster than a hedgehog on blast processing."" If that sparks a grin of recognition, Gotta Protectors is for you.    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them?  As it turns out, plenty.     The realm of Magicadia is one of those unfortunate kingdoms rarely not under siege by evil forces, as Princess Lola and her lineup of eight loyal guardians learn at the opening of Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness. As with previous games, the princess must be defended from onslaughts of hostile foes, yet their new quest brings an offensive push. Instead of just sitting in her castle, Lola rides it along railroad tracks to reach the enemy stronghold. And then she gleefully slams her fortress into the enemy castle until her target explodes in a mushroom cloud. Princess Lola is clearly a go-getter.    To defend the princess on her castle-train journey, the player picks three of the Gotta Protectors and fends off a furious horde of creatures. Switching out with a simple command, the heroes span familiar archetypes with humorous touches; the short-range fighter, spell-hurling mage, and long-range archer play it relatively straight, but the ninja speeds around in merely a mask and a loincloth, the unflatteringly named Oldguy lumbers forth with a toy horse bolted around his waist, and the shaman-like oracle wears a candle headband and a constant expression of guilty, wild-eyed terror.     There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks. If you want to play defensively, you can erect barriers to slow down enemies, who'll busy themselves pouncing on the roadblocks while you plan your next move or simply strike at your foes. And if the barricades are damaged, you can fix them by attacking them—just like in real life.     Gotta Protectors is similarly calculated in its appearances. The characters and enemies are small and simple in design, but it's all so the game can cram as many characters as possible into the playfield without a hint of slowdown. It's easy to lose sight of a hero in the chaos of goblin throngs, glowing minotaurs, flying arrows, bursting spells, and the constant power-up cheers of the princess and her locomotive castle. Yet even if you're confused, the game offers quick solutions. When in doubt, button-mashing will usually get you through. Perhaps a little too often.    Slamming attacks into hundreds of enemies per stage is repetitive at first, but again Gotta Protectors builds things up. With three characters on your team, it's best to go for the variety of standard attackers, long-range projectile experts, and one of the less easily pigeonholed characters like the Oracle or Prince. Each mission brings in cash that can be used to upgrade your defense, attack power, barricade sturdiness, or the power of the princess herself. Unfortunately, those stat boosts disappear after each four-part mission, dismantling any level-ups you've purchased.     Long-term satisfaction lies elsewhere. Save your money, and you can upgrade characters' actual abilities in a fairy-run shop. Each Gotta Protectors hero has several stock playstyles that carry over once purchased, and you're free to make a custom profile with your favorite acquired moves. It brings great variety to the gameplay, even if you're only allowed three characters in battle.    Gotta Protectors is rarely lacking in cute style, whether it's the pleasantly detailed graphics assembled by programmers with decades of experience, the punchy soundtrack from industry legend Yuzo Koshiro, or just the characters quibbling. Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl. Instead, Gotta Protectors is reminiscent of Game Center CX and its DS titles, paying constant and humorous tribute to an era while still standing on its own.     The game openly invites multiplayer at all times, with three spare slots at the screen's top even when you're playing solo. It's only more hectic with other characters on the playfield, and that's entirely the point. Having other heroes along to help and annoy each other patches up the occasional monotonous attacking, and the online play seemed smooth at this writing.    Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness carefully and forcefully looks back to the days of the NES and Famicom, and that's hardly a rare aim these days. Yet there's much more to the game than the overloaded trappings of an 8-bit game too technically impressive to have actually existed back then. It's refreshingly complicated and relentlessly charming despite some repetition, and that earns it a wide-reaching recommendation, even for those players who won't get the joke in an NES-like cartridge called “Hoagie's Aisle.”             Grade:      Overall : B+ Graphics : A- Sound/Music : B Gameplay : B+ Presentation : B+  + Lovingly detailed pixel art, a perfect sense of humor, enjoyable battles both solo and in multiplayer − Combat is occasionally tedious, upgrade system resets too often            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                       Game Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Game Review   by Todd Ciolek, Apr 23rd 2022       Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Nintendo Switch                     Description:             Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.      Review:         Description:        Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.     Review:            There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters, better animation, and smoother play than any 8-bit system could manage. Are they neo-retro? Noveau 8-bit? Nostalgia traps? Whatever the movement might be called, Gotta Protectors was there at the start, with Protect Me Knight in 2010 and Gotta Protectors in 2016. And now Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness arrives on the Switch so thick with retro attachment that the initial screen mimics a fuzzy TV signal, while the game itself wastes few screens before its princess protagonist squeals that her castle is moving ""faster than a hedgehog on blast processing."" If that sparks a grin of recognition, Gotta Protectors is for you.    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them?  As it turns out, plenty.     The realm of Magicadia is one of those unfortunate kingdoms rarely not under siege by evil forces, as Princess Lola and her lineup of eight loyal guardians learn at the opening of Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness. As with previous games, the princess must be defended from onslaughts of hostile foes, yet their new quest brings an offensive push. Instead of just sitting in her castle, Lola rides it along railroad tracks to reach the enemy stronghold. And then she gleefully slams her fortress into the enemy castle until her target explodes in a mushroom cloud. Princess Lola is clearly a go-getter.    To defend the princess on her castle-train journey, the player picks three of the Gotta Protectors and fends off a furious horde of creatures. Switching out with a simple command, the heroes span familiar archetypes with humorous touches; the short-range fighter, spell-hurling mage, and long-range archer play it relatively straight, but the ninja speeds around in merely a mask and a loincloth, the unflatteringly named Oldguy lumbers forth with a toy horse bolted around his waist, and the shaman-like oracle wears a candle headband and a constant expression of guilty, wild-eyed terror.     There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks. If you want to play defensively, you can erect barriers to slow down enemies, who'll busy themselves pouncing on the roadblocks while you plan your next move or simply strike at your foes. And if the barricades are damaged, you can fix them by attacking them—just like in real life.     Gotta Protectors is similarly calculated in its appearances. The characters and enemies are small and simple in design, but it's all so the game can cram as many characters as possible into the playfield without a hint of slowdown. It's easy to lose sight of a hero in the chaos of goblin throngs, glowing minotaurs, flying arrows, bursting spells, and the constant power-up cheers of the princess and her locomotive castle. Yet even if you're confused, the game offers quick solutions. When in doubt, button-mashing will usually get you through. Perhaps a little too often.    Slamming attacks into hundreds of enemies per stage is repetitive at first, but again Gotta Protectors builds things up. With three characters on your team, it's best to go for the variety of standard attackers, long-range projectile experts, and one of the less easily pigeonholed characters like the Oracle or Prince. Each mission brings in cash that can be used to upgrade your defense, attack power, barricade sturdiness, or the power of the princess herself. Unfortunately, those stat boosts disappear after each four-part mission, dismantling any level-ups you've purchased.     Long-term satisfaction lies elsewhere. Save your money, and you can upgrade characters' actual abilities in a fairy-run shop. Each Gotta Protectors hero has several stock playstyles that carry over once purchased, and you're free to make a custom profile with your favorite acquired moves. It brings great variety to the gameplay, even if you're only allowed three characters in battle.    Gotta Protectors is rarely lacking in cute style, whether it's the pleasantly detailed graphics assembled by programmers with decades of experience, the punchy soundtrack from industry legend Yuzo Koshiro, or just the characters quibbling. Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl. Instead, Gotta Protectors is reminiscent of Game Center CX and its DS titles, paying constant and humorous tribute to an era while still standing on its own.     The game openly invites multiplayer at all times, with three spare slots at the screen's top even when you're playing solo. It's only more hectic with other characters on the playfield, and that's entirely the point. Having other heroes along to help and annoy each other patches up the occasional monotonous attacking, and the online play seemed smooth at this writing.    Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness carefully and forcefully looks back to the days of the NES and Famicom, and that's hardly a rare aim these days. Yet there's much more to the game than the overloaded trappings of an 8-bit game too technically impressive to have actually existed back then. It's refreshingly complicated and relentlessly charming despite some repetition, and that earns it a wide-reaching recommendation, even for those players who won't get the joke in an NES-like cartridge called “Hoagie's Aisle.”             Grade:      Overall : B+ Graphics : A- Sound/Music : B Gameplay : B+ Presentation : B+  + Lovingly detailed pixel art, a perfect sense of humor, enjoyable battles both solo and in multiplayer − Combat is occasionally tedious, upgrade system resets too often            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                       Game Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Game Review   by Todd Ciolek, Apr 23rd 2022       Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Nintendo Switch                     Description:             Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.      Review:         Description:        Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.     Review:            There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters, better animation, and smoother play than any 8-bit system could manage. Are they neo-retro? Noveau 8-bit? Nostalgia traps? Whatever the movement might be called, Gotta Protectors was there at the start, with Protect Me Knight in 2010 and Gotta Protectors in 2016. And now Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness arrives on the Switch so thick with retro attachment that the initial screen mimics a fuzzy TV signal, while the game itself wastes few screens before its princess protagonist squeals that her castle is moving ""faster than a hedgehog on blast processing."" If that sparks a grin of recognition, Gotta Protectors is for you.    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them?  As it turns out, plenty.     The realm of Magicadia is one of those unfortunate kingdoms rarely not under siege by evil forces, as Princess Lola and her lineup of eight loyal guardians learn at the opening of Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness. As with previous games, the princess must be defended from onslaughts of hostile foes, yet their new quest brings an offensive push. Instead of just sitting in her castle, Lola rides it along railroad tracks to reach the enemy stronghold. And then she gleefully slams her fortress into the enemy castle until her target explodes in a mushroom cloud. Princess Lola is clearly a go-getter.    To defend the princess on her castle-train journey, the player picks three of the Gotta Protectors and fends off a furious horde of creatures. Switching out with a simple command, the heroes span familiar archetypes with humorous touches; the short-range fighter, spell-hurling mage, and long-range archer play it relatively straight, but the ninja speeds around in merely a mask and a loincloth, the unflatteringly named Oldguy lumbers forth with a toy horse bolted around his waist, and the shaman-like oracle wears a candle headband and a constant expression of guilty, wild-eyed terror.     There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks. If you want to play defensively, you can erect barriers to slow down enemies, who'll busy themselves pouncing on the roadblocks while you plan your next move or simply strike at your foes. And if the barricades are damaged, you can fix them by attacking them—just like in real life.     Gotta Protectors is similarly calculated in its appearances. The characters and enemies are small and simple in design, but it's all so the game can cram as many characters as possible into the playfield without a hint of slowdown. It's easy to lose sight of a hero in the chaos of goblin throngs, glowing minotaurs, flying arrows, bursting spells, and the constant power-up cheers of the princess and her locomotive castle. Yet even if you're confused, the game offers quick solutions. When in doubt, button-mashing will usually get you through. Perhaps a little too often.    Slamming attacks into hundreds of enemies per stage is repetitive at first, but again Gotta Protectors builds things up. With three characters on your team, it's best to go for the variety of standard attackers, long-range projectile experts, and one of the less easily pigeonholed characters like the Oracle or Prince. Each mission brings in cash that can be used to upgrade your defense, attack power, barricade sturdiness, or the power of the princess herself. Unfortunately, those stat boosts disappear after each four-part mission, dismantling any level-ups you've purchased.     Long-term satisfaction lies elsewhere. Save your money, and you can upgrade characters' actual abilities in a fairy-run shop. Each Gotta Protectors hero has several stock playstyles that carry over once purchased, and you're free to make a custom profile with your favorite acquired moves. It brings great variety to the gameplay, even if you're only allowed three characters in battle.    Gotta Protectors is rarely lacking in cute style, whether it's the pleasantly detailed graphics assembled by programmers with decades of experience, the punchy soundtrack from industry legend Yuzo Koshiro, or just the characters quibbling. Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl. Instead, Gotta Protectors is reminiscent of Game Center CX and its DS titles, paying constant and humorous tribute to an era while still standing on its own.     The game openly invites multiplayer at all times, with three spare slots at the screen's top even when you're playing solo. It's only more hectic with other characters on the playfield, and that's entirely the point. Having other heroes along to help and annoy each other patches up the occasional monotonous attacking, and the online play seemed smooth at this writing.    Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness carefully and forcefully looks back to the days of the NES and Famicom, and that's hardly a rare aim these days. Yet there's much more to the game than the overloaded trappings of an 8-bit game too technically impressive to have actually existed back then. It's refreshingly complicated and relentlessly charming despite some repetition, and that earns it a wide-reaching recommendation, even for those players who won't get the joke in an NES-like cartridge called “Hoagie's Aisle.”             Grade:      Overall : B+ Graphics : A- Sound/Music : B Gameplay : B+ Presentation : B+  + Lovingly detailed pixel art, a perfect sense of humor, enjoyable battles both solo and in multiplayer − Combat is occasionally tedious, upgrade system resets too often            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                       Game Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.        This Week in Games - Nintendo and Sega, How Could You? Micro-transactions and union-busting top the news this week as we try to figure out which Sonic Origins version to buy to get the whole game.

The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hund...                    ep. review          126 comments       Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story ‒ SERIES FINALE   Apr 21, 23:30 126 comments                 anime    What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.                    ep. review          12 comments       Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 21, 03:30 12 comments                 anime    This isn't your dad's golf.

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell.

Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.        This Week in Games - Nintendo and Sega, How Could You? Micro-transactions and union-busting top the news this week as we try to figure out which Sonic Origins version to buy to get the whole game.        This Week in Anime - What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  Estab Life: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.        Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?        This Week in Anime - Does Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean Hold Up? Kenichi Sonoda's musclehead getaway driver Bean Bandit is the subject of a recent crowdfunding campaign for a new anime short, 30 years after he appeared in Riding Bean. Jean-Karlo and Nicky evaluate how both anime hold up, warts and all.  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          5 comments       Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision ‒ Episode 30   Apr 23, 03:30 5 comments                 anime    It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan.                    ep. review          5 comments       Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 23, 02:30 5 comments                 anime    Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb.

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games.

The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really?

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell.

Forum - View topicNEWS: Crunchyroll Reveals English Dub Premieres, Casts for Love After World Domination, Kaguya-sama:            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        KitKat1721    Joined: 03 Feb 2015 		    Posts: 715       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 2:58 pm            Some mixed feelings on the temporary recasting situation here for Kaguya-sama.   On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

I guess Funi VA's are going to be busier than ever. I think Alexis Tipton is in, like, 3-4 shows this season (although she was always pretty busy) and same goes for a lot of Funimation's big name VA's.

Note that I am talking about shows that are not sequel, side stories, or prequels to other shows. Not sure how much of an the idea of more union dubs would be an issue.

He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan. And he was just the narrator in last season's Tokusatsu parody, Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, which was an even smaller show.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

I guess Funi VA's are going to be busier than ever. I think Alexis Tipton is in, like, 3-4 shows this season (although she was always pretty busy) and same goes for a lot of Funimation's big name VA's.

So, why now might Funi and Sony Pictures be hesitant to have more remote recording done for the premiering Spring 2022 anime simuldubs, even if it was just 2 shows? Note that I am talking about shows that are not sequel, side stories, or prequels to other shows. Not sure how much of an the idea of more union dubs would be an issue.

Because, y'know.           ? He does anime all the time. He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan. And he was just the narrator in last season's Tokusatsu parody, Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, which was an even smaller show.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether. The dubbing medium had a wonderful thing going on then the sky started to fall where every active Funimation ADR Director embraced mediocrity for their casting methods.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3957       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 3:16 pm            I figured Kaguya season 3 was inevitable. I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

I guess Funi VA's are going to be busier than ever. I think Alexis Tipton is in, like, 3-4 shows this season (although she was always pretty busy) and same goes for a lot of Funimation's big name VA's.

He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan. And he was just the narrator in last season's Tokusatsu parody, Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, which was an even smaller show.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether. The dubbing medium had a wonderful thing going on then the sky started to fall where every active Funimation ADR Director embraced mediocrity for their casting methods.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan. And he was just the narrator in last season's Tokusatsu parody, Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, which was an even smaller show.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out.

As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.

I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

I guess Funi VA's are going to be busier than ever. I think Alexis Tipton is in, like, 3-4 shows this season (although she was always pretty busy) and same goes for a lot of Funimation's big name VA's.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether. The dubbing medium had a wonderful thing going on then the sky started to fall where every active Funimation ADR Director embraced mediocrity for their casting methods.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

It generally makes sense, but just feels kind of wordy at times. Maybe it's an Aniplex thing?   I started playing the game a few weeks ago and the dialogue there seems more polished and easier to follow than the anime series.

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize. I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.      Back to top                  db999    Joined: 23 Dec 2017 		    Posts: 125       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 6:18 pm            I'm really enjoying this series. I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

It generally makes sense, but just feels kind of wordy at times. Maybe it's an Aniplex thing?   I started playing the game a few weeks ago and the dialogue there seems more polished and easier to follow than the anime series.

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize. I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

It generally makes sense, but just feels kind of wordy at times. Maybe it's an Aniplex thing?   I started playing the game a few weeks ago and the dialogue there seems more polished and easier to follow than the anime series.

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize. I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related.

It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.

There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.
