REVIEW: Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        John Thacker    Joined: 28 Oct 2013 		    Posts: 961       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 2:59 pm              Quote:    It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings.   Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

Capitol of the Bee Train ""girls with guns on the run"" series of the 00s, Nafrece is now home to the finest sports anime I have seen in years.    Great review. Truly outstanding.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

Capitol of the Bee Train ""girls with guns on the run"" series of the 00s, Nafrece is now home to the finest sports anime I have seen in years.    Great review. Truly outstanding.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

Shame that there are at least two worthless m*les who are relevant. Serious letdown, reminds me a lot of Two Car. Hopefully those m*les don't get in the way of the Golf Girls' Story and the girls will stand out more. At least this is what the poster should have been.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie.

Capitol of the Bee Train ""girls with guns on the run"" series of the 00s, Nafrece is now home to the finest sports anime I have seen in years.    Great review. Truly outstanding.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

I regret to inform you that Adam Sandler has kept making movies with the same exact attitudes to this day despite whatever culture war nonsense you've decided stopped him.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there.

(Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well.

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

23-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/cms/discuss/184834,EP. REVIEW: Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," I still can't quite get over that we're supposed to just accept that poor orphan illegal squatter, must-hustle-to-eat Eve just kind of decided to go for golf, the ultimate ""very rich person"" sport. I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.      RenRen94 wrote:    Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time.

News Yuu Watase's Arata: The Legend Manga Moves Online in May   posted on 2022-04-22 16:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga resumed after 6-year hiatus in May 2021    This year's 21st issue of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine revealed on Wednesday that Yuu Watase's Arata: The Legend (Arata Kangatari) manga will transfer to Shogakukan's Sunday Webry (Sunday Web Every) manga website beginning with its next chapter, which will debut on Sunday Webry on May 4.    Watase stated on Twitter that the reason for the transfer was due to her health. She stated with serialization on the Sunday Webry website, if things became difficult she would be able to immediately put the manga on hiatus and rest. Conversely with a magazine, putting a manga immediately on hiatus can be troublesome for others.    The manga returned from a six-year hiatus in Weekly Shonen Sunday in May 2021. The manga went on hiatus in 2015.    Prior to last year's continuation of the manga, Watase last resumed the manga in July 2015 (after an earlier 17-month hiatus), only to put the manga back on hiatus a month later. The remastered version of the 15th volume shipped on April 18.    Watase had said on Twitter in December 2020 that she was able to solidify the rest of the plot for the manga.    Watase stated on Twitter in July 2019 that she was planning to start a new arc for the manga in the 14th volume. Watase previously stated that she was considering resuming the manga in 2018, adding at the time that she was still recovering from depression.    The manga debuted in Weekly Shonen Sunday in 2008. Viz Media publishes the manga English, and it describes the manga's story:   In a mythical world where humans and gods co-exist, Arata has the unfortunate honor of being the successor to the matriarchal Hime Clan. This means he has to pretend to be a girl or face death if his true gender is discovered! On the day of his inauguration, an assassination plot forces him to flee - and he somehow winds up in modern-day Japan! Meanwhile, a boy named Arata Hinohara gets sucked into the first Arata's world and finds himself dealing with people after his life!   The manga received a 12-episode anime adaptation in 2013, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.

News Yuu Watase's Arata: The Legend Manga Moves Online in May   posted on 2022-04-22 16:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga resumed after 6-year hiatus in May 2021    This year's 21st issue of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine revealed on Wednesday that Yuu Watase's Arata: The Legend (Arata Kangatari) manga will transfer to Shogakukan's Sunday Webry (Sunday Web Every) manga website beginning with its next chapter, which will debut on Sunday Webry on May 4.    Watase stated on Twitter that the reason for the transfer was due to her health. She stated with serialization on the Sunday Webry website, if things became difficult she would be able to immediately put the manga on hiatus and rest. Conversely with a magazine, putting a manga immediately on hiatus can be troublesome for others.    The manga returned from a six-year hiatus in Weekly Shonen Sunday in May 2021. The manga went on hiatus in 2015.    Prior to last year's continuation of the manga, Watase last resumed the manga in July 2015 (after an earlier 17-month hiatus), only to put the manga back on hiatus a month later. The remastered version of the 15th volume shipped on April 18.    Watase had said on Twitter in December 2020 that she was able to solidify the rest of the plot for the manga.    Watase stated on Twitter in July 2019 that she was planning to start a new arc for the manga in the 14th volume. Watase previously stated that she was considering resuming the manga in 2018, adding at the time that she was still recovering from depression.    The manga debuted in Weekly Shonen Sunday in 2008. Viz Media publishes the manga English, and it describes the manga's story:   In a mythical world where humans and gods co-exist, Arata has the unfortunate honor of being the successor to the matriarchal Hime Clan. This means he has to pretend to be a girl or face death if his true gender is discovered! On the day of his inauguration, an assassination plot forces him to flee - and he somehow winds up in modern-day Japan! Meanwhile, a boy named Arata Hinohara gets sucked into the first Arata's world and finds himself dealing with people after his life!   The manga received a 12-episode anime adaptation in 2013, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.

News Yuu Watase's Arata: The Legend Manga Moves Online in May   posted on 2022-04-22 16:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga resumed after 6-year hiatus in May 2021    This year's 21st issue of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine revealed on Wednesday that Yuu Watase's Arata: The Legend (Arata Kangatari) manga will transfer to Shogakukan's Sunday Webry (Sunday Web Every) manga website beginning with its next chapter, which will debut on Sunday Webry on May 4.    Watase stated on Twitter that the reason for the transfer was due to her health. She stated with serialization on the Sunday Webry website, if things became difficult she would be able to immediately put the manga on hiatus and rest. Conversely with a magazine, putting a manga immediately on hiatus can be troublesome for others.    The manga returned from a six-year hiatus in Weekly Shonen Sunday in May 2021. The manga went on hiatus in 2015.    Prior to last year's continuation of the manga, Watase last resumed the manga in July 2015 (after an earlier 17-month hiatus), only to put the manga back on hiatus a month later. The remastered version of the 15th volume shipped on April 18.    Watase had said on Twitter in December 2020 that she was able to solidify the rest of the plot for the manga.    Watase stated on Twitter in July 2019 that she was planning to start a new arc for the manga in the 14th volume. Watase previously stated that she was considering resuming the manga in 2018, adding at the time that she was still recovering from depression.    The manga debuted in Weekly Shonen Sunday in 2008. Viz Media publishes the manga English, and it describes the manga's story:   In a mythical world where humans and gods co-exist, Arata has the unfortunate honor of being the successor to the matriarchal Hime Clan. This means he has to pretend to be a girl or face death if his true gender is discovered! On the day of his inauguration, an assassination plot forces him to flee - and he somehow winds up in modern-day Japan! Meanwhile, a boy named Arata Hinohara gets sucked into the first Arata's world and finds himself dealing with people after his life!   The manga received a 12-episode anime adaptation in 2013, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.

Viz Media publishes the manga English, and it describes the manga's story:   In a mythical world where humans and gods co-exist, Arata has the unfortunate honor of being the successor to the matriarchal Hime Clan. This means he has to pretend to be a girl or face death if his true gender is discovered! On the day of his inauguration, an assassination plot forces him to flee - and he somehow winds up in modern-day Japan! Meanwhile, a boy named Arata Hinohara gets sucked into the first Arata's world and finds himself dealing with people after his life!   The manga received a 12-episode anime adaptation in 2013, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

It's a place infested by hapless human sou...                    column          11 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Ristorante Paradiso and Gente   2014 May 23, 02:08 11 comments                 manga    Shaenon explores Natsume Ono's manga for folks with a thing for seniors. ―  Ristorante Paradiso and Gente In last week's column, Jason commented, “There's plenty of manga about oyajicon (old guy fetish), like Ristorante Paradiso.” But really, there kind of isn't. Manga skews young, especially the manga that makes it to English translation, and most teenage readers aren't that into old guys.

Bunny Drop is a manga about a 30-year-old single father raising a child, not a ""lovable bundle of sunshine"" child like Yotsuba&!,but a sligh...                    column          25 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Cross Game   2014 May  9, 01:23 25 comments                 manga    Mitsuru Adachi's beloved baseball manga masterpiece Cross Game throws Shaenon a straight pitch right down the middle. ―  Cross Game If you ever have the chance to attend Mass at the Vatican or a baseball game at a major Japanese stadium, take it.

It's simple, but it summons up imagery of fantasy worlds and distant deserts, deep green forests and strange cultures. Like the Kyoko Hikawa manga it describes, it's evocative, but it's also simple and direct.

Stop laughing over your copies of Black Bird and Midnight Secretary—I swear it's true.

It's easy to see why publishers prefer long series that can keep generating sales indefinitely; for the last several decades, the trend has been toward longer and longer manga, and hi...                    column          12 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Usamaru Furuya   2014 Mar 21, 00:00 12 comments                 people    Jason takes a stroll through the work of the intensely versatile, controversial and talented mangaka Usamaru Furuya. ―  Usamaru Furuya ""I used to do 'serious' art, and manga was just an extension of that.…Now I want to create more entertaining types of worlds, like creating a Hollywood movie.""

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days.

News Manga Plus Adds Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 02:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga debuted in April 2020    Shueisha's MANGA Plus service added Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga on Wednesday. The first four chapters are on the service.    The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact.    Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love is War) and Yokoyari (Scum's Wish) launched the Oshi no Ko (My Stan's Kid) manga in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in April 2020. Shueisha's published the manga's seventh compiled book volume on February 22.    The manga won in the Best General Manga category in the 46th annual Kodansha Manga awards this year. The manga was nominated for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize this year. The manga has also been nominated for the 14th and 15th Manga Taisho Awards. The manga ranked at #7 on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2022 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Akasaka's Kaguya-sama: Love is War manga launched in Shueisha's Miracle Jump magazine in May 2015 but it moved to Young Jump in March 2016. The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in January 2019, as well as a second season that premiered in April 2020. The anime's third season premiered on April 9. The manga also inspired a live-action film that opened in Japan in September 2019. A sequel film opened in August 2021.    Yokoyari's Scum's Wish manga ran in Square Enix's Big Gangan magazine from 2012 until March 2017. Square Enix published eight compiled book volumes for the manga. The manga also received the Scum's Wish décor spinoff manga, which launched in Big Gangan in November 2017, and ended in May 2018. Square Enix shipped a compiled book volume for the manga as the ninth volume of Scum's Wish in July 2018. The manga inspired both a television anime series and a live-action series, which ran in parallel beginning in January 2017. Both series adapted the entire story of the manga.

News Manga Plus Adds Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 02:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga debuted in April 2020    Shueisha's MANGA Plus service added Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga on Wednesday. The first four chapters are on the service.    The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact.    Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love is War) and Yokoyari (Scum's Wish) launched the Oshi no Ko (My Stan's Kid) manga in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in April 2020. Shueisha's published the manga's seventh compiled book volume on February 22.    The manga won in the Best General Manga category in the 46th annual Kodansha Manga awards this year. The manga was nominated for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize this year. The manga has also been nominated for the 14th and 15th Manga Taisho Awards. The manga ranked at #7 on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2022 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Akasaka's Kaguya-sama: Love is War manga launched in Shueisha's Miracle Jump magazine in May 2015 but it moved to Young Jump in March 2016. The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in January 2019, as well as a second season that premiered in April 2020. The anime's third season premiered on April 9. The manga also inspired a live-action film that opened in Japan in September 2019. A sequel film opened in August 2021.    Yokoyari's Scum's Wish manga ran in Square Enix's Big Gangan magazine from 2012 until March 2017. Square Enix published eight compiled book volumes for the manga. The manga also received the Scum's Wish décor spinoff manga, which launched in Big Gangan in November 2017, and ended in May 2018. Square Enix shipped a compiled book volume for the manga as the ninth volume of Scum's Wish in July 2018. The manga inspired both a television anime series and a live-action series, which ran in parallel beginning in January 2017. Both series adapted the entire story of the manga.

News Manga Plus Adds Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 02:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga debuted in April 2020    Shueisha's MANGA Plus service added Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga on Wednesday. The first four chapters are on the service.    The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact.    Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love is War) and Yokoyari (Scum's Wish) launched the Oshi no Ko (My Stan's Kid) manga in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in April 2020. Shueisha's published the manga's seventh compiled book volume on February 22.    The manga won in the Best General Manga category in the 46th annual Kodansha Manga awards this year. The manga was nominated for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize this year. The manga has also been nominated for the 14th and 15th Manga Taisho Awards. The manga ranked at #7 on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2022 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Akasaka's Kaguya-sama: Love is War manga launched in Shueisha's Miracle Jump magazine in May 2015 but it moved to Young Jump in March 2016. The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in January 2019, as well as a second season that premiered in April 2020. The anime's third season premiered on April 9. The manga also inspired a live-action film that opened in Japan in September 2019. A sequel film opened in August 2021.    Yokoyari's Scum's Wish manga ran in Square Enix's Big Gangan magazine from 2012 until March 2017. Square Enix published eight compiled book volumes for the manga. The manga also received the Scum's Wish décor spinoff manga, which launched in Big Gangan in November 2017, and ended in May 2018. Square Enix shipped a compiled book volume for the manga as the ninth volume of Scum's Wish in July 2018. The manga inspired both a television anime series and a live-action series, which ran in parallel beginning in January 2017. Both series adapted the entire story of the manga.

New Dance Music Brand FUTUREmode Launched by avex, with Three Tracks Including 'Shiny Starting Line' by YUC'e as First Releases   Apr 23rd 2022         Japanese culture fans, don't miss this! New dance music brand FUTUREmode launched by avex, with three tracks including ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e as first releases!   Japan's pioneering record label avex, which has created numerous dance music movements including SUPER EUROBEAT and Cyber TRANCE, launched new dance music brand FUTUREmode on Wednesday, April 20. The project's first three tracks were released over three consecutive days.  ▼ FUTUREmode introduction movie: https://youtu.be/eKTZrGTBzZk  FUTUREmode is a new kind of dance music brand that presents talented artists and producers from genres that have evolved uniquely both within the music scene and within Japan – genres with a rich pool of talented artists such as future bass, kawaii future bass and melodic dubstep.  The project launched this week with the following three releases, each of which was accompanied by a music video on FUTUREmode's YouTube channel:  Wednesday, April 20: YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’  Thursday, April 21: you – ‘Kimochi Switch’  Friday, April 22: chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’  —--------------------------  About the releases ① YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ (released Wednesday, April 20)  FUTUREmode's first track – released on the project's launch day – was ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e, a multi-creative artist who handles everything from songwriting to vocals. YUC’e is a globally active artist: Half of her audience on Spotify are based outside of Japan, mainly in the United States.  ‘Shiny Starting Line’ is a portal to YUC’e's world, with lyrics that express the new start we associate with spring – and, of course, the start of this exciting new brand. It is a song that combines the signature sound YUC’e has cultivated with the feeling of expectation that comes with a new beginning.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/ShinyStartingLine  In the music video, the pensive “Girl A” sits in a coin laundry, where people of all walks of life converge; beyond the circular mashing-machine windows lined up like the windows of a plane, she gazes at each person's new departure, an emotional scene that expresses the song's sentiment of new beginnings.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ music video: https://youtu.be/-BqP2uVqWzw  ② you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ (released Thursday, April 21)  The second release is by you, an artist based in Tokyo whose motto is to create “sounds that make listeners happy”, and who has provided songs for PC and mobile games, rhythm games, idols, VTubers, pro gaming teams and more, while also hosting his own DJ events.  The track begins with a mellow lo-fi hip-hop intro that suddenly changes to light future bass at the sound of a flicking switch. This unusual fusion of contrasting genres results in a unique song that sounds like nothing else. The future bass part will make you dance without even realizing it, shaking out the stiffness in your mind and body.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/KimochiSwitch  At the start of the music video, we see “Girl A” doing her nails in her room with a look of boredom.

New Dance Music Brand FUTUREmode Launched by avex, with Three Tracks Including 'Shiny Starting Line' by YUC'e as First Releases   Apr 23rd 2022         Japanese culture fans, don't miss this! New dance music brand FUTUREmode launched by avex, with three tracks including ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e as first releases!   Japan's pioneering record label avex, which has created numerous dance music movements including SUPER EUROBEAT and Cyber TRANCE, launched new dance music brand FUTUREmode on Wednesday, April 20. The project's first three tracks were released over three consecutive days.  ▼ FUTUREmode introduction movie: https://youtu.be/eKTZrGTBzZk  FUTUREmode is a new kind of dance music brand that presents talented artists and producers from genres that have evolved uniquely both within the music scene and within Japan – genres with a rich pool of talented artists such as future bass, kawaii future bass and melodic dubstep.  The project launched this week with the following three releases, each of which was accompanied by a music video on FUTUREmode's YouTube channel:  Wednesday, April 20: YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’  Thursday, April 21: you – ‘Kimochi Switch’  Friday, April 22: chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’  —--------------------------  About the releases ① YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ (released Wednesday, April 20)  FUTUREmode's first track – released on the project's launch day – was ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e, a multi-creative artist who handles everything from songwriting to vocals. YUC’e is a globally active artist: Half of her audience on Spotify are based outside of Japan, mainly in the United States.  ‘Shiny Starting Line’ is a portal to YUC’e's world, with lyrics that express the new start we associate with spring – and, of course, the start of this exciting new brand. It is a song that combines the signature sound YUC’e has cultivated with the feeling of expectation that comes with a new beginning.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/ShinyStartingLine  In the music video, the pensive “Girl A” sits in a coin laundry, where people of all walks of life converge; beyond the circular mashing-machine windows lined up like the windows of a plane, she gazes at each person's new departure, an emotional scene that expresses the song's sentiment of new beginnings.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ music video: https://youtu.be/-BqP2uVqWzw  ② you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ (released Thursday, April 21)  The second release is by you, an artist based in Tokyo whose motto is to create “sounds that make listeners happy”, and who has provided songs for PC and mobile games, rhythm games, idols, VTubers, pro gaming teams and more, while also hosting his own DJ events.  The track begins with a mellow lo-fi hip-hop intro that suddenly changes to light future bass at the sound of a flicking switch. This unusual fusion of contrasting genres results in a unique song that sounds like nothing else. The future bass part will make you dance without even realizing it, shaking out the stiffness in your mind and body.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/KimochiSwitch  At the start of the music video, we see “Girl A” doing her nails in her room with a look of boredom. When the switch is flipped on her music player, future bass flows out of the speakers, her mood rises, and she begins to dance around her room.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ music video: https://youtu.be/ePEnwqoIk8s  ③ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ (released Friday, April 22)  The third track is the first ever release by new producer chamrass. Within urban electronic sounds, we hear the occasional click of a shutter, the twittering of birdsong. It's an emotional and nostalgic dance track that you can listen to on an endless loop, mixing urban and sentimental vibes with a feeling of melancholy.  ▼ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/UrbanNostalgia  The music video is a visual expression of the title ‘Urban Nostalgia’, combining an inner-city world with melancholic nature.  ▼ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ music video: https://youtu.be/cQpLNw8KY20  —--------------------------  FUTUREmode is all about an extravagant and uplifting dance sound, which is echoed in everything from the illustration of “Girl A” who appears in the music videos and jacket artwork, to the stylish yet aggressive logo whose design motif merges an “F” with a play button symbol, creating a truly unique world of its own.  In addition to the selection of producers and artists who will provide the music, each release will also include an exciting visual element to enjoy, featuring the talents of a variety of up-and-coming illustrators, animators and video producers.  It has been announced that the FUTUREmode project will release a total of seven songs by Wednesday, May 18, including the three songs released this week, so look out for future releases coming soon.

New Dance Music Brand FUTUREmode Launched by avex, with Three Tracks Including 'Shiny Starting Line' by YUC'e as First Releases   Apr 23rd 2022         Japanese culture fans, don't miss this! New dance music brand FUTUREmode launched by avex, with three tracks including ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e as first releases!   Japan's pioneering record label avex, which has created numerous dance music movements including SUPER EUROBEAT and Cyber TRANCE, launched new dance music brand FUTUREmode on Wednesday, April 20. The project's first three tracks were released over three consecutive days.  ▼ FUTUREmode introduction movie: https://youtu.be/eKTZrGTBzZk  FUTUREmode is a new kind of dance music brand that presents talented artists and producers from genres that have evolved uniquely both within the music scene and within Japan – genres with a rich pool of talented artists such as future bass, kawaii future bass and melodic dubstep.  The project launched this week with the following three releases, each of which was accompanied by a music video on FUTUREmode's YouTube channel:  Wednesday, April 20: YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’  Thursday, April 21: you – ‘Kimochi Switch’  Friday, April 22: chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’  —--------------------------  About the releases ① YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ (released Wednesday, April 20)  FUTUREmode's first track – released on the project's launch day – was ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e, a multi-creative artist who handles everything from songwriting to vocals. YUC’e is a globally active artist: Half of her audience on Spotify are based outside of Japan, mainly in the United States.  ‘Shiny Starting Line’ is a portal to YUC’e's world, with lyrics that express the new start we associate with spring – and, of course, the start of this exciting new brand. It is a song that combines the signature sound YUC’e has cultivated with the feeling of expectation that comes with a new beginning.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/ShinyStartingLine  In the music video, the pensive “Girl A” sits in a coin laundry, where people of all walks of life converge; beyond the circular mashing-machine windows lined up like the windows of a plane, she gazes at each person's new departure, an emotional scene that expresses the song's sentiment of new beginnings.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ music video: https://youtu.be/-BqP2uVqWzw  ② you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ (released Thursday, April 21)  The second release is by you, an artist based in Tokyo whose motto is to create “sounds that make listeners happy”, and who has provided songs for PC and mobile games, rhythm games, idols, VTubers, pro gaming teams and more, while also hosting his own DJ events.  The track begins with a mellow lo-fi hip-hop intro that suddenly changes to light future bass at the sound of a flicking switch. This unusual fusion of contrasting genres results in a unique song that sounds like nothing else. The future bass part will make you dance without even realizing it, shaking out the stiffness in your mind and body.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/KimochiSwitch  At the start of the music video, we see “Girl A” doing her nails in her room with a look of boredom. When the switch is flipped on her music player, future bass flows out of the speakers, her mood rises, and she begins to dance around her room.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ music video: https://youtu.be/ePEnwqoIk8s  ③ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ (released Friday, April 22)  The third track is the first ever release by new producer chamrass. Within urban electronic sounds, we hear the occasional click of a shutter, the twittering of birdsong. It's an emotional and nostalgic dance track that you can listen to on an endless loop, mixing urban and sentimental vibes with a feeling of melancholy.  ▼ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/UrbanNostalgia  The music video is a visual expression of the title ‘Urban Nostalgia’, combining an inner-city world with melancholic nature.  ▼ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ music video: https://youtu.be/cQpLNw8KY20  —--------------------------  FUTUREmode is all about an extravagant and uplifting dance sound, which is echoed in everything from the illustration of “Girl A” who appears in the music videos and jacket artwork, to the stylish yet aggressive logo whose design motif merges an “F” with a play button symbol, creating a truly unique world of its own.  In addition to the selection of producers and artists who will provide the music, each release will also include an exciting visual element to enjoy, featuring the talents of a variety of up-and-coming illustrators, animators and video producers.  It has been announced that the FUTUREmode project will release a total of seven songs by Wednesday, May 18, including the three songs released this week, so look out for future releases coming soon.

New Dance Music Brand FUTUREmode Launched by avex, with Three Tracks Including 'Shiny Starting Line' by YUC'e as First Releases   Apr 23rd 2022         Japanese culture fans, don't miss this! New dance music brand FUTUREmode launched by avex, with three tracks including ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e as first releases!   Japan's pioneering record label avex, which has created numerous dance music movements including SUPER EUROBEAT and Cyber TRANCE, launched new dance music brand FUTUREmode on Wednesday, April 20. The project's first three tracks were released over three consecutive days.  ▼ FUTUREmode introduction movie: https://youtu.be/eKTZrGTBzZk  FUTUREmode is a new kind of dance music brand that presents talented artists and producers from genres that have evolved uniquely both within the music scene and within Japan – genres with a rich pool of talented artists such as future bass, kawaii future bass and melodic dubstep.  The project launched this week with the following three releases, each of which was accompanied by a music video on FUTUREmode's YouTube channel:  Wednesday, April 20: YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’  Thursday, April 21: you – ‘Kimochi Switch’  Friday, April 22: chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’  —--------------------------  About the releases ① YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ (released Wednesday, April 20)  FUTUREmode's first track – released on the project's launch day – was ‘Shiny Starting Line’ by YUC’e, a multi-creative artist who handles everything from songwriting to vocals. YUC’e is a globally active artist: Half of her audience on Spotify are based outside of Japan, mainly in the United States.  ‘Shiny Starting Line’ is a portal to YUC’e's world, with lyrics that express the new start we associate with spring – and, of course, the start of this exciting new brand. It is a song that combines the signature sound YUC’e has cultivated with the feeling of expectation that comes with a new beginning.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/ShinyStartingLine  In the music video, the pensive “Girl A” sits in a coin laundry, where people of all walks of life converge; beyond the circular mashing-machine windows lined up like the windows of a plane, she gazes at each person's new departure, an emotional scene that expresses the song's sentiment of new beginnings.  ▼ YUC’e – ‘Shiny Starting Line’ music video: https://youtu.be/-BqP2uVqWzw  ② you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ (released Thursday, April 21)  The second release is by you, an artist based in Tokyo whose motto is to create “sounds that make listeners happy”, and who has provided songs for PC and mobile games, rhythm games, idols, VTubers, pro gaming teams and more, while also hosting his own DJ events.  The track begins with a mellow lo-fi hip-hop intro that suddenly changes to light future bass at the sound of a flicking switch. This unusual fusion of contrasting genres results in a unique song that sounds like nothing else. The future bass part will make you dance without even realizing it, shaking out the stiffness in your mind and body.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/KimochiSwitch  At the start of the music video, we see “Girl A” doing her nails in her room with a look of boredom. When the switch is flipped on her music player, future bass flows out of the speakers, her mood rises, and she begins to dance around her room.  ▼ you – ‘Kimochi Switch’ music video: https://youtu.be/ePEnwqoIk8s  ③ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ (released Friday, April 22)  The third track is the first ever release by new producer chamrass. Within urban electronic sounds, we hear the occasional click of a shutter, the twittering of birdsong. It's an emotional and nostalgic dance track that you can listen to on an endless loop, mixing urban and sentimental vibes with a feeling of melancholy.  ▼ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ download and streaming links: https://FUTUREmode.lnk.to/UrbanNostalgia  The music video is a visual expression of the title ‘Urban Nostalgia’, combining an inner-city world with melancholic nature.  ▼ chamrass – ‘Urban Nostalgia’ music video: https://youtu.be/cQpLNw8KY20  —--------------------------  FUTUREmode is all about an extravagant and uplifting dance sound, which is echoed in everything from the illustration of “Girl A” who appears in the music videos and jacket artwork, to the stylish yet aggressive logo whose design motif merges an “F” with a play button symbol, creating a truly unique world of its own.  In addition to the selection of producers and artists who will provide the music, each release will also include an exciting visual element to enjoy, featuring the talents of a variety of up-and-coming illustrators, animators and video producers.  It has been announced that the FUTUREmode project will release a total of seven songs by Wednesday, May 18, including the three songs released this week, so look out for future releases coming soon.

Healer Girl Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6                    How would you rate episode 2 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 4.2            On paper, Healer Girl isn't all that exceptional. Its premise of healing through the literal power of song is novel, if only for how it's very much not a metaphor – these girls have to study pharmacology and physiology alongside singing in order to get their license to practice – but its basic story of high school girls working, training, and laughing together is a pretty familiar one in anime. But who cares about on paper, really? Unless you're an extreme form of music nerd you don't experience a song by looking at the sheet music – you listen to it and let the sound speak for itself. In the same way, this show comes alive through its presentation, both visual and audio, to be an infectiously charming watch.    It can't be overstated just how endearing it is to watch this show in the moment, and how much of that is down to its buoyant animation and music. The character designs pack in a ton of appeal despite their animation-friendly simplicity, with details like the main girls' two-toned hair helping them stick out without ever feeling too busy. In motion, every character is lively and expressive, pulling out a truly impressive range of faces with every episode that makes their simple personalities feel larger than life in just the right way. While the musical “Image” scene in the premiere felt a bit simple, the one we see in episode two is genuinely inspired, bringing the entire sequence to a fantastic climax that sold me on the premise of healing song better than I ever expected.    Speaking of the music, if you're going to enjoy this show you will need at least a healthy tolerance for sappy ballads. That's not usually my scene, but I can't deny that the music here, especially in the climactic Healing segments, is super well-produced. Every instrument comes in at just the right moment to complement the actress' singing, and when they're allowed to really belt I'll admit to getting swept up in the moment. But really, it's the way the show implements that music that really sticks out. Episode three opens and closes with full-on Recitative musical numbers, first as the main trio quiz each other for their upcoming exam, and again when they're racing at a neighborhood track meet, turning what could be perfunctory exposition and a typical foot race into incredibly fun moments of song and animation. It's just not something you see in anime, where musical moments are typically in-universe performances or non-diegetic insert songs, and it gives Healer Girl something to really stand out from its Cute Girl anime peers.    Though just because the characters are simple and familiar doesn't mean they can't be plenty fun on their own. I like that Kana, while very much the bright-eyed genki girl, has kind of a mischievous side to her with how she's constantly trying to weasel her way out of the more tedious parts of her training. Reimi steals the show whenever she's around, and while her mentor-crush on their teacher could get old soon, she offers some much-needed drive to our main trio. Plus her ongoing roller-coaster relationship with the clinic cat is the single best gag in the entire show. Hibiki is definitely the weakest personality so far, but she offers some necessary grounding to keep the other two from totally running off course. They have a solid rapport, and combined with the musical presentation and lively pacing of each episode, they're a ton of fun to follow.    Though right now my favorite is the musical gremlin known as Sonia. What can I say, I like tiny girls with big egos and the determination to defeat all challengers, imagined or otherwise. I'm glad the show is able to undercut her for comedy without undermining her very real skills as a Healer – that's an important balance to keep this kind of rival (in her mind, anyway) funny without being unduly meanspirited. I also have a soft spot for Shoko, if only because somebody who drinks a highball in the middle of the day while on chaperon duty is a woman after my own heart. Ria is a more straightforward mentor right now, but she's a nice enough teacher and obviously an accomplished Healer in her own right. Personally my favorite moment with her was finding out even her snoring sounds like singing. That's just good comedy right there.    Overall, even if Healer Girl isn't reinventing the wheel (or the record), that doesn't really matter in the face of just how much fun these opening episodes have been to watch. My only real hangup is that I don't know how well any of these characters will be able to carry drama, assuming there will be some heavier moments in the future. This is still essentially a medical drama underneath the magic and music, and that leaves room for some real tragedy. For now though, I'm more than happy to hum along to its tune.

Healer Girl Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6                    How would you rate episode 2 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 3 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 4.2            On paper, Healer Girl isn't all that exceptional. Its premise of healing through the literal power of song is novel, if only for how it's very much not a metaphor – these girls have to study pharmacology and physiology alongside singing in order to get their license to practice – but its basic story of high school girls working, training, and laughing together is a pretty familiar one in anime. But who cares about on paper, really? Unless you're an extreme form of music nerd you don't experience a song by looking at the sheet music – you listen to it and let the sound speak for itself. In the same way, this show comes alive through its presentation, both visual and audio, to be an infectiously charming watch.    It can't be overstated just how endearing it is to watch this show in the moment, and how much of that is down to its buoyant animation and music. The character designs pack in a ton of appeal despite their animation-friendly simplicity, with details like the main girls' two-toned hair helping them stick out without ever feeling too busy. In motion, every character is lively and expressive, pulling out a truly impressive range of faces with every episode that makes their simple personalities feel larger than life in just the right way. While the musical “Image” scene in the premiere felt a bit simple, the one we see in episode two is genuinely inspired, bringing the entire sequence to a fantastic climax that sold me on the premise of healing song better than I ever expected.    Speaking of the music, if you're going to enjoy this show you will need at least a healthy tolerance for sappy ballads. That's not usually my scene, but I can't deny that the music here, especially in the climactic Healing segments, is super well-produced. Every instrument comes in at just the right moment to complement the actress' singing, and when they're allowed to really belt I'll admit to getting swept up in the moment. But really, it's the way the show implements that music that really sticks out. Episode three opens and closes with full-on Recitative musical numbers, first as the main trio quiz each other for their upcoming exam, and again when they're racing at a neighborhood track meet, turning what could be perfunctory exposition and a typical foot race into incredibly fun moments of song and animation. It's just not something you see in anime, where musical moments are typically in-universe performances or non-diegetic insert songs, and it gives Healer Girl something to really stand out from its Cute Girl anime peers.    Though just because the characters are simple and familiar doesn't mean they can't be plenty fun on their own. I like that Kana, while very much the bright-eyed genki girl, has kind of a mischievous side to her with how she's constantly trying to weasel her way out of the more tedious parts of her training. Reimi steals the show whenever she's around, and while her mentor-crush on their teacher could get old soon, she offers some much-needed drive to our main trio. Plus her ongoing roller-coaster relationship with the clinic cat is the single best gag in the entire show. Hibiki is definitely the weakest personality so far, but she offers some necessary grounding to keep the other two from totally running off course. They have a solid rapport, and combined with the musical presentation and lively pacing of each episode, they're a ton of fun to follow.    Though right now my favorite is the musical gremlin known as Sonia. What can I say, I like tiny girls with big egos and the determination to defeat all challengers, imagined or otherwise. I'm glad the show is able to undercut her for comedy without undermining her very real skills as a Healer – that's an important balance to keep this kind of rival (in her mind, anyway) funny without being unduly meanspirited. I also have a soft spot for Shoko, if only because somebody who drinks a highball in the middle of the day while on chaperon duty is a woman after my own heart. Ria is a more straightforward mentor right now, but she's a nice enough teacher and obviously an accomplished Healer in her own right. Personally my favorite moment with her was finding out even her snoring sounds like singing. That's just good comedy right there.    Overall, even if Healer Girl isn't reinventing the wheel (or the record), that doesn't really matter in the face of just how much fun these opening episodes have been to watch. My only real hangup is that I don't know how well any of these characters will be able to carry drama, assuming there will be some heavier moments in the future. This is still essentially a medical drama underneath the magic and music, and that leaves room for some real tragedy. For now though, I'm more than happy to hum along to its tune.

It can't be overstated just how endearing it is to watch this show in the moment, and how much of that is down to its buoyant animation and music. The character designs pack in a ton of appeal despite their animation-friendly simplicity, with details like the main girls' two-toned hair helping them stick out without ever feeling too busy. In motion, every character is lively and expressive, pulling out a truly impressive range of faces with every episode that makes their simple personalities feel larger than life in just the right way. While the musical “Image” scene in the premiere felt a bit simple, the one we see in episode two is genuinely inspired, bringing the entire sequence to a fantastic climax that sold me on the premise of healing song better than I ever expected.    Speaking of the music, if you're going to enjoy this show you will need at least a healthy tolerance for sappy ballads. That's not usually my scene, but I can't deny that the music here, especially in the climactic Healing segments, is super well-produced. Every instrument comes in at just the right moment to complement the actress' singing, and when they're allowed to really belt I'll admit to getting swept up in the moment. But really, it's the way the show implements that music that really sticks out. Episode three opens and closes with full-on Recitative musical numbers, first as the main trio quiz each other for their upcoming exam, and again when they're racing at a neighborhood track meet, turning what could be perfunctory exposition and a typical foot race into incredibly fun moments of song and animation. It's just not something you see in anime, where musical moments are typically in-universe performances or non-diegetic insert songs, and it gives Healer Girl something to really stand out from its Cute Girl anime peers.    Though just because the characters are simple and familiar doesn't mean they can't be plenty fun on their own. I like that Kana, while very much the bright-eyed genki girl, has kind of a mischievous side to her with how she's constantly trying to weasel her way out of the more tedious parts of her training. Reimi steals the show whenever she's around, and while her mentor-crush on their teacher could get old soon, she offers some much-needed drive to our main trio. Plus her ongoing roller-coaster relationship with the clinic cat is the single best gag in the entire show. Hibiki is definitely the weakest personality so far, but she offers some necessary grounding to keep the other two from totally running off course. They have a solid rapport, and combined with the musical presentation and lively pacing of each episode, they're a ton of fun to follow.    Though right now my favorite is the musical gremlin known as Sonia. What can I say, I like tiny girls with big egos and the determination to defeat all challengers, imagined or otherwise. I'm glad the show is able to undercut her for comedy without undermining her very real skills as a Healer – that's an important balance to keep this kind of rival (in her mind, anyway) funny without being unduly meanspirited. I also have a soft spot for Shoko, if only because somebody who drinks a highball in the middle of the day while on chaperon duty is a woman after my own heart. Ria is a more straightforward mentor right now, but she's a nice enough teacher and obviously an accomplished Healer in her own right. Personally my favorite moment with her was finding out even her snoring sounds like singing. That's just good comedy right there.    Overall, even if Healer Girl isn't reinventing the wheel (or the record), that doesn't really matter in the face of just how much fun these opening episodes have been to watch. My only real hangup is that I don't know how well any of these characters will be able to carry drama, assuming there will be some heavier moments in the future. This is still essentially a medical drama underneath the magic and music, and that leaves room for some real tragedy. For now though, I'm more than happy to hum along to its tune.

Healer Girl Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?

Its premise of healing through the literal power of song is novel, if only for how it's very much not a metaphor – these girls have to study pharmacology and physiology alongside singing in order to get their license to practice – but its basic story of high school girls working, training, and laughing together is a pretty familiar one in anime.

In the same way, this show comes alive through its presentation, both visual and audio, to be an infectiously charming watch.    It can't be overstated just how endearing it is to watch this show in the moment, and how much of that is down to its buoyant animation and music. The character designs pack in a ton of appeal despite their animation-friendly simplicity, with details like the main girls' two-toned hair helping them stick out without ever feeling too busy. In motion, every character is lively and expressive, pulling out a truly impressive range of faces with every episode that makes their simple personalities feel larger than life in just the right way. While the musical “Image” scene in the premiere felt a bit simple, the one we see in episode two is genuinely inspired, bringing the entire sequence to a fantastic climax that sold me on the premise of healing song better than I ever expected.    Speaking of the music, if you're going to enjoy this show you will need at least a healthy tolerance for sappy ballads. That's not usually my scene, but I can't deny that the music here, especially in the climactic Healing segments, is super well-produced. Every instrument comes in at just the right moment to complement the actress' singing, and when they're allowed to really belt I'll admit to getting swept up in the moment. But really, it's the way the show implements that music that really sticks out. Episode three opens and closes with full-on Recitative musical numbers, first as the main trio quiz each other for their upcoming exam, and again when they're racing at a neighborhood track meet, turning what could be perfunctory exposition and a typical foot race into incredibly fun moments of song and animation. It's just not something you see in anime, where musical moments are typically in-universe performances or non-diegetic insert songs, and it gives Healer Girl something to really stand out from its Cute Girl anime peers.    Though just because the characters are simple and familiar doesn't mean they can't be plenty fun on their own. I like that Kana, while very much the bright-eyed genki girl, has kind of a mischievous side to her with how she's constantly trying to weasel her way out of the more tedious parts of her training. Reimi steals the show whenever she's around, and while her mentor-crush on their teacher could get old soon, she offers some much-needed drive to our main trio. Plus her ongoing roller-coaster relationship with the clinic cat is the single best gag in the entire show. Hibiki is definitely the weakest personality so far, but she offers some necessary grounding to keep the other two from totally running off course. They have a solid rapport, and combined with the musical presentation and lively pacing of each episode, they're a ton of fun to follow.    Though right now my favorite is the musical gremlin known as Sonia. What can I say, I like tiny girls with big egos and the determination to defeat all challengers, imagined or otherwise. I'm glad the show is able to undercut her for comedy without undermining her very real skills as a Healer – that's an important balance to keep this kind of rival (in her mind, anyway) funny without being unduly meanspirited. I also have a soft spot for Shoko, if only because somebody who drinks a highball in the middle of the day while on chaperon duty is a woman after my own heart. Ria is a more straightforward mentor right now, but she's a nice enough teacher and obviously an accomplished Healer in her own right. Personally my favorite moment with her was finding out even her snoring sounds like singing. That's just good comedy right there.    Overall, even if Healer Girl isn't reinventing the wheel (or the record), that doesn't really matter in the face of just how much fun these opening episodes have been to watch. My only real hangup is that I don't know how well any of these characters will be able to carry drama, assuming there will be some heavier moments in the future. This is still essentially a medical drama underneath the magic and music, and that leaves room for some real tragedy. For now though, I'm more than happy to hum along to its tune.

But who cares about on paper, really? Unless you're an extreme form of music nerd you don't experience a song by looking at the sheet music – you listen to it and let the sound speak for itself. In the same way, this show comes alive through its presentation, both visual and audio, to be an infectiously charming watch.    It can't be overstated just how endearing it is to watch this show in the moment, and how much of that is down to its buoyant animation and music. The character designs pack in a ton of appeal despite their animation-friendly simplicity, with details like the main girls' two-toned hair helping them stick out without ever feeling too busy. In motion, every character is lively and expressive, pulling out a truly impressive range of faces with every episode that makes their simple personalities feel larger than life in just the right way. While the musical “Image” scene in the premiere felt a bit simple, the one we see in episode two is genuinely inspired, bringing the entire sequence to a fantastic climax that sold me on the premise of healing song better than I ever expected.    Speaking of the music, if you're going to enjoy this show you will need at least a healthy tolerance for sappy ballads. That's not usually my scene, but I can't deny that the music here, especially in the climactic Healing segments, is super well-produced. Every instrument comes in at just the right moment to complement the actress' singing, and when they're allowed to really belt I'll admit to getting swept up in the moment. But really, it's the way the show implements that music that really sticks out. Episode three opens and closes with full-on Recitative musical numbers, first as the main trio quiz each other for their upcoming exam, and again when they're racing at a neighborhood track meet, turning what could be perfunctory exposition and a typical foot race into incredibly fun moments of song and animation. It's just not something you see in anime, where musical moments are typically in-universe performances or non-diegetic insert songs, and it gives Healer Girl something to really stand out from its Cute Girl anime peers.    Though just because the characters are simple and familiar doesn't mean they can't be plenty fun on their own. I like that Kana, while very much the bright-eyed genki girl, has kind of a mischievous side to her with how she's constantly trying to weasel her way out of the more tedious parts of her training. Reimi steals the show whenever she's around, and while her mentor-crush on their teacher could get old soon, she offers some much-needed drive to our main trio. Plus her ongoing roller-coaster relationship with the clinic cat is the single best gag in the entire show. Hibiki is definitely the weakest personality so far, but she offers some necessary grounding to keep the other two from totally running off course. They have a solid rapport, and combined with the musical presentation and lively pacing of each episode, they're a ton of fun to follow.    Though right now my favorite is the musical gremlin known as Sonia. What can I say, I like tiny girls with big egos and the determination to defeat all challengers, imagined or otherwise. I'm glad the show is able to undercut her for comedy without undermining her very real skills as a Healer – that's an important balance to keep this kind of rival (in her mind, anyway) funny without being unduly meanspirited. I also have a soft spot for Shoko, if only because somebody who drinks a highball in the middle of the day while on chaperon duty is a woman after my own heart. Ria is a more straightforward mentor right now, but she's a nice enough teacher and obviously an accomplished Healer in her own right. Personally my favorite moment with her was finding out even her snoring sounds like singing. That's just good comedy right there.    Overall, even if Healer Girl isn't reinventing the wheel (or the record), that doesn't really matter in the face of just how much fun these opening episodes have been to watch. My only real hangup is that I don't know how well any of these characters will be able to carry drama, assuming there will be some heavier moments in the future. This is still essentially a medical drama underneath the magic and music, and that leaves room for some real tragedy. For now though, I'm more than happy to hum along to its tune.

Interest Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-Sensei Inspires Adorable Paw Brush   posted on 2022-04-22 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy           Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-sensei is no stranger to adorable merch. His latest is a paw-shaped ""Kumanofude"" brush, used here for applying makeup.     The Kumanofude is a brand of brush that originated in Hiroshima's Kumano City. Historically renowned as makers of calligraphy and art brushes, the Kumanofude's distinctively soft texture also makes for ideal makeup brushes.    Utensil maker Kiddy Land opened orders for the Nyanko-sensei paw brush in Japan through Yahoo! Shopping on Wednesday. Brushes cost 4,180 yen (approximately US$32). Kiddy Land is also reissuing previous popular Nyanko-sensei goods, such as aprons, frying pans, and mittens as part of its latest lineup.

Interest Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-Sensei Inspires Adorable Paw Brush   posted on 2022-04-22 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy           Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-sensei is no stranger to adorable merch. His latest is a paw-shaped ""Kumanofude"" brush, used here for applying makeup.     The Kumanofude is a brand of brush that originated in Hiroshima's Kumano City. Historically renowned as makers of calligraphy and art brushes, the Kumanofude's distinctively soft texture also makes for ideal makeup brushes.    Utensil maker Kiddy Land opened orders for the Nyanko-sensei paw brush in Japan through Yahoo! Shopping on Wednesday. Brushes cost 4,180 yen (approximately US$32). Kiddy Land is also reissuing previous popular Nyanko-sensei goods, such as aprons, frying pans, and mittens as part of its latest lineup.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film Posts New Trailer Featuring Movie-Original Character Akagumo   posted on 2022-04-22 19:45 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Film opens in Japan on April 29    ASMIK Ace's official YouTube channel began streaming a video on Friday for it and Shochiku's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga. The video includes clips featuring Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character, before featuring a trailer for the film.      The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 but is currently on hiatus. The manga is slated to return next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film Posts New Trailer Featuring Movie-Original Character Akagumo   posted on 2022-04-22 19:45 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Film opens in Japan on April 29    ASMIK Ace's official YouTube channel began streaming a video on Friday for it and Shochiku's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga. The video includes clips featuring Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character, before featuring a trailer for the film.      The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 but is currently on hiatus. The manga is slated to return next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

The video includes clips featuring Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character, before featuring a trailer for the film.      The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 but is currently on hiatus. The manga is slated to return next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

I have not been to shibuya but I am willing to bet that isn't the norm for live presentations.

Glad there's actually a little more there to get invested in/to keep up with.

If an English singer suddenly showed up at an event I went to and started singing in Japanese but massacred the pronunciation, I don't think I'd be able to tell since the lyric would just be gibberish to me either way.    The audience does have to remember her quite a bit since they actually need to know her name to look it up. Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event. I do agree that the anime is trying to have some commentary on success, but that's why I'm disappointed in how they handled this since instead of timing, planning or talent, her success seems to be more about plot armour.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief. But i totally get your point      Back to top                  Electric Wooloo    Joined: 19 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 195       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 8:23 am              meiam wrote:       MiloTheFirst wrote:    She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

The audience does have to remember her quite a bit since they actually need to know her name to look it up. Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

A musician doesn't need to be world class in order to be commercially successful, just clear a minimum bar of proficiency and figure out a great marketing strategy           Would a Japanese audience even be able to tell that the English pronunciation is good? If an English singer suddenly showed up at an event I went to and started singing in Japanese but massacred the pronunciation, I don't think I'd be able to tell since the lyric would just be gibberish to me either way.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.         You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?

(Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.         Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?            She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation. I have not been to shibuya but I am willing to bet that isn't the norm for live presentations. Eitherway, the audience doesn't have to be blown away by her performance to decide subscribing to her instagram which is what kongming needs at this stage in order to get her jigs.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event. I do agree that the anime is trying to have some commentary on success, but that's why I'm disappointed in how they handled this since instead of timing, planning or talent, her success seems to be more about plot armour.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief. But i totally get your point      Back to top                  Electric Wooloo    Joined: 19 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 195       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 8:23 am              meiam wrote:       MiloTheFirst wrote:    She does have her own gimmick, she mainly sings songs in full english and with an actual pretty good pronunciation.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go. It just anime really doesn't depict that much of a crowd until later.    But ironically, event organizers are actually strictly supposed to not do that IRL - because of the safety measures.

Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.         You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

The audience does have to remember her quite a bit since they actually need to know her name to look it up. Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event. I do agree that the anime is trying to have some commentary on success, but that's why I'm disappointed in how they handled this since instead of timing, planning or talent, her success seems to be more about plot armour.            But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

Actually, it is very possible - if even the small room was actually highly packed - so people actually get confused because of the unusual design of the room (octagon with identical walls, two exits and the round scene in the center is actually quite an example of that), smoke, flickering lights and constantly changing landmarks to which people can navigate to which door they want to go.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice. (Plus, it's surprisingly good English singing for anime that makes it different enough to pass, considering the anime events happening in Shibuya)   Anything that you describe can work in something like an idol show to make the character different enough to shine (pointing at Deremasu), or something like a contest (like Carole & Tuesday) - but YBK plot is not about that, and that things barely works for the music that will play in your typical dance club. Gimmicks are for people who love gimmicks and go to listen exactly this, not for normie party-goers. For everything other, Kongming exists.

His plan to pack the room only work if the room is already packed...         Well, that's where it gets the anime shenanigans (and the power of free drinks). Plus Kongming grabbed the people from the backlines, where are usually placed not the fans - they are usually hanging near the scene, which is the better spot to look at the singer and hear the music - but the occasional viewers who just enjoying the show to stay, which is a fun detail.    But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

You have a point about the songs of Eiko being unoriginal, but what you describe is also missing a big thing - she's supposed to be just a newbie singer that singing in the clubs and festivals first, so her auditory is also basically your normie clubbers that want for something to dance with and by such EDM pop is just a good choice.

But like the Kongming said - the whole plan is not supposed to trap the listeners inside the room, but stalemate them enough inside to hear Eiko singing and let them decide if she's worth their time. Without her being good in captivating people with her music it was an impossible plan all along.     Quote:    Why would anyone remember her then? Do normie clubber go to a club and remember the just average singer that they didn't even intent on going to watch in the first place?         Same point as earlier - while she's average level as a singer, she is also talented enough to make a show and captivate people who never heard her before (again, she is a small club part-timer waitress with no name before Kongming goes full management on her) to make them stay with her.    That's the whole plot point - only the talent cannot make you get recognition, but good management sure can make even the average talent shine to make it to the top.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

The audience does have to remember her quite a bit since they actually need to know her name to look it up. Her counter showed hundreds of added follower, the room size was pretty small so it couldn't hold more than a thousand (even that sound like a stretch) so the anime is implying that most of the audience decided to follow her after the event. I do agree that the anime is trying to have some commentary on success, but that's why I'm disappointed in how they handled this since instead of timing, planning or talent, her success seems to be more about plot armour.

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt.

I don't really care for that thrift-shop shorts-hoodie-ballcap look even for casual wear (maybe in part because she reminds me too much of Haru Shirokane from Tribe Nine), but on stage she ought to look like she tried to dress for the occasion.  At least lose the ugly ballcap.   Other than that, I'm enjoying pretty much everything about this.

Remember, Eiko isn't just representing herself, she's also kind of Lu Bei, a commoner who claims born of noble blood called to a higher calling so she could always look like a thrift store reject because that's who she is.   Or she's not Lu Bei and the whole story is just a coincidence but I think that's more unlikely by the episode. It's not one for one but there is a bit of ""hey, that kind of seems like..."" A musclebound warrior who doesn't heed her ""strategist""? A trio who keep trying but failing?   If you look at the premise as a second chance for Kongming to do right where he went wrong, there has to be some element of ""different battleground, same war"".

I think they could tell the difference between good pronunciation and bad pronunciation even if the random average person isn't good at the language themselves. They do study english while in compulsory education. I am Speaking from experience, I am not a native English speaker myself and even when I was a kid I could easily tell apart the pronunciation proficiency of my fellow students from that of the English teacher and movies, even while i still didn't understand the vocabulary much   Regarding the amount of subs she got, it was only a thousand, I think it would still be reasonable to assume that a quarter or even half of those could be friends/followers of the attendees that didn't go to the venue but saw a post in their feed praising EIKO and decided to follow her. Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely. I don't think that scene demanded too much suspension of disbelief.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

Subs are a very whimsical commitment feee act, people sometimes just do it out of curiosity and unsubscribe later or forget about it entirely.

But... it is about timing, planning, and talent  It's saying that no matter how talented you are that talent won't be recognized without proper exposure.  The entirety of episode 3 was specifically planning a situation to make the biggest entrance, and judging by the very end of the episode it got more than just the audience's attention.   As for followers, I'm pretty sure only a small % of Mia's 100,000 ""Pinsta"" followers ever saw her in person. People follow things they're vaguely interested in and it spreads via friends of friends as the algorithm brings it to their attention.   Someone with 500 followers or something makes a post going ""Wow this Eiko singer was better than expected, best part of the show!"" and if even 5% of that 500 in turn follow her that 1 person who saw her live counts for 26 followers.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere.

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible.

But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, ghost stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese ghost stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western ghost stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, ghost stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese ghost stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western ghost stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, ghost stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese ghost stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western ghost stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Interest Voice Actors Maaya Sakamoto, Kenichi Suzumura Give Birth to 1st Child   posted on 2022-04-22 14:01 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy           The agencies of voice actors Maaya Sakamoto and Kenichi Suzumura announced on Thursday that the couple have given birth to their first child.    The actors issued the following joint statement: ""Our first child was born the other day. Both mother and child are healthy. We will endeavor to grow alongside our child. I hope you can continue to support us.""    Sakamoto and Suzumura announced their marriage in 2011. The two voice cast members both worked on Ouran High School Host Club, Kara no Kyōkai - the Garden of sinners, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny, Black Butler II, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Star Driver Kagayaki no Takuto, Soul Eater, and Birdy the Mighty: Decode.    In December, they announced that they were expecting their first child. Sakamoto explained that this was the reason she was taking a break from work over the past few months, and that she plans to gradually return to work as her body's condition improves.
