Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?

Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 11 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2.

The two actors  are reprisals from Grimoire of Zero (including AmaLee as Zero) so, it's not a meaningful difference to what has been done so far this season as it would be pretty counterproductive to recast them and potentially annoy viewers further.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Ever since the merger (assimilation rather) between Funimation and Crunchyroll, have the dubs still been as good? Funimation's best strength was their ability to play loose with the script and have the dialogue more accessible to an American audience. Is that still the case or have the scripts become more literal? I ask because I would be deeply saddened if English Dubbed anime lost something that, when done right, can make a dub truly shine.   This might just be me having an ""Okay Boomer"" moment though. I haven't watched any recent dubs (like, none from the last two years I'd say) so I'm just making assumptions.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Ever since the merger (assimilation rather) between Funimation and Crunchyroll, have the dubs still been as good? Funimation's best strength was their ability to play loose with the script and have the dialogue more accessible to an American audience. Is that still the case or have the scripts become more literal? I ask because I would be deeply saddened if English Dubbed anime lost something that, when done right, can make a dub truly shine.   This might just be me having an ""Okay Boomer"" moment though. I haven't watched any recent dubs (like, none from the last two years I'd say) so I'm just making assumptions.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Ever since the merger (assimilation rather) between Funimation and Crunchyroll, have the dubs still been as good? Funimation's best strength was their ability to play loose with the script and have the dialogue more accessible to an American audience. Is that still the case or have the scripts become more literal? I ask because I would be deeply saddened if English Dubbed anime lost something that, when done right, can make a dub truly shine.   This might just be me having an ""Okay Boomer"" moment though. I haven't watched any recent dubs (like, none from the last two years I'd say) so I'm just making assumptions.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Funimation's best strength was their ability to play loose with the script and have the dialogue more accessible to an American audience.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Wait ... what? The whole ""in sickness and in health whether richer or poorer"" vow applies to marriage. If they were engaged, fine. If they had been together for a long time and the subject of marriage never came up ... well maybe she just dodged a bullet. Girlfriends and boyfriends are even less obligated to stick around during rough patches than longtime platonic friends are. Particularly if the reason for the boyfriend's being down in the dumps in the first place is ""failed at my (very low percentage of success just as everyone warned me) dream of being a professional musician and now I have absolutely nothing going on for my long term financial future."" Being the boyfriend of the 1 guy in 100 who actually succeeds at being a professional musician? Very cool and worth the risk of sticking around for awhile! Being the boyfriend of the other 99? Not so much. Tell him to catch up with you a couple years down the line after he's maybe finished a vocational program or something, has career prospects lined up and if he's lucky you may actually still be single. Sounds harsh but there is a reason why some guys choose boring reliable things like accounting.

Call me crazy, but the impression I was getting from the end is that there was some dumb communication problem and that Kanako didn't think she left him, but that he left her (and vice versa for Nagomu).

Maybe, but I thought the scene pretty clearly showed him crying over a letter that said that his dad was in the hospital so he needed to come home, he asked her to come with him, and instead she just packed her bags and told him she preferred western sweets before walking out. That may be his misinterpretation of events rather than what actually happened, but it's also the only full perspective we have at this point.

She seemed baffled when he said she dumped her at the festival, and told Itsuka she got dumped by him.

If she wasn't sure she could do long-distance or move to be with him she could have said ""I have to think about this.""   Though with these kind of shows we get to know every central character a lot and they're well rounded and human, so I think there's a lot more to her than what we've seen.

She framed it as ""he chose his family over me,"" which is a rather selfish point of view unless they were engaged or had been together for most of the ten years he'd been in Tokyo.  Even then, the situation wasn't either/or, as she painted it. He asked her to come with him, and it was her that chose, what, her job?  Tokyo? over him. She didn't even give him an ultimatum of a choice, just packed up and left. It seemed to me that she revised things in her mind so that she wasn't the bad guy, as people often do to salvage their self-image as a good person.   I don't even think she was necessarily wrong to not go with him, but the way she did it was really cold.  I guess we'll have to see how she shakes out in future episodes, but I'm definitely of mixed feelings about her right now.   Anyway, I am enjoying the delicious watercolor backgrounds.

I think there's a lack of communication between them for sure, but uprooting your entire life, job, connections, etc. to move halfway across the country with your boyfriend is a big ask. I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.   Perhaps there's MORE of a miscommunication going on with the letter we've seen in flashbacks, perhaps she was expecting to come back and be able to talk it over with him the next day but he left immediately assuming her walking out was a break up. Either way Kanoko is having second thoughts after all.   I personally really like her as a character. There's not an ounce of bitterness between the two characters after breaking up, just some awkwardness, and they all have different priorities in life that they're figuring out how to get straight.

I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.           As I said, it was how she ended it, not that she ended it, that was cold.  Just silently packing her things and then verbally flipping him off with ""I like Western sweets,"" as she walked out, when he believed his family needed him, was pretty harsh no matter what her reasons for not wanting to go were.   Also ""halfway across the country"" is a bit different in Japan, than say, the US.  Tokyo to Kyoto is a five and a half hour drive or 2-4 hours by train, depending on which train. In CA a 2-hr one-way daily commute isn't rare.  So it wouldn't be unreasonable to try long distance for awhile until both of them decided on what they wanted to do, instead of just flat walking out like she did.

She took him for granted expecting him to hang around like a puppy and when he didn't she took it as him ending it. Hence the line of him choosing his family over her, she's just bitter that he betrayed her expectations.  In short she was selfcentered and arrogant.   In the van when talking to him she thought that he would be hopeless without her yet, his doing fine. At the end she was surprised when he remembered the promise and again when he said that she dumped him.    With a bit of luck the experience has tought her some humility.

Maybe it's just over abbreviated. Giving everyone involved a little bit of credit, it's a bit ""mistakes were made"" on both sides.   She had a job, and he just announced he was leaving without consulting her at all (and just assumed she'd come too), which is pretty much the bare minimum you should expect from anyone committed to a relationship. He was also clearly being ridiculous in suggesting only he could carry a business that employs a dozen people and he's not even set foot in for a decade. She however didn't attempt to hear him out, reason with him, or offer any kind of support (though I think she had arrived with the intent of consoling him over the breakup of the band). Just got up and left which is pretty damn cold to a guy clearly in a lot of distress. That said, from what else we've seen of Nagomu, it's reasonable to assume she was dealing with this kind of shit all the time, and possibly just didn't have the patience in the moment to explain to him why he was being a child, yet again, and he needed to take a step back and approach the situation like the adult he supposedly is.    I think if anyone was talking those around them for granted it was Nagomu. Both his parents and Kanoko. He was upset, who wouldn't be to be contacted out of the blue to say your Dad's in hospital, but he was impulsively making some very big decisions that would affect both their lives. That's my read on the ""western sweets"" remark - it's blunt and insensitive, but the emotion is ""how dare you just assume I'd drop everything to come work in your family sweet shop?"". Kanoko could have handled it a hell of a lot better, but I've got some sympathy for the reaction.

Wait ... what? The whole ""in sickness and in health whether richer or poorer"" vow applies to marriage. If they were engaged, fine. If they had been together for a long time and the subject of marriage never came up ... well maybe she just dodged a bullet. Girlfriends and boyfriends are even less obligated to stick around during rough patches than longtime platonic friends are. Particularly if the reason for the boyfriend's being down in the dumps in the first place is ""failed at my (very low percentage of success just as everyone warned me) dream of being a professional musician and now I have absolutely nothing going on for my long term financial future."" Being the boyfriend of the 1 guy in 100 who actually succeeds at being a professional musician? Very cool and worth the risk of sticking around for awhile! Being the boyfriend of the other 99? Not so much. Tell him to catch up with you a couple years down the line after he's maybe finished a vocational program or something, has career prospects lined up and if he's lucky you may actually still be single. Sounds harsh but there is a reason why some guys choose boring reliable things like accounting.

Call me crazy, but the impression I was getting from the end is that there was some dumb communication problem and that Kanako didn't think she left him, but that he left her (and vice versa for Nagomu).

Maybe, but I thought the scene pretty clearly showed him crying over a letter that said that his dad was in the hospital so he needed to come home, he asked her to come with him, and instead she just packed her bags and told him she preferred western sweets before walking out. That may be his misinterpretation of events rather than what actually happened, but it's also the only full perspective we have at this point.

She seemed baffled when he said she dumped her at the festival, and told Itsuka she got dumped by him.

If she wasn't sure she could do long-distance or move to be with him she could have said ""I have to think about this.""   Though with these kind of shows we get to know every central character a lot and they're well rounded and human, so I think there's a lot more to her than what we've seen.

She framed it as ""he chose his family over me,"" which is a rather selfish point of view unless they were engaged or had been together for most of the ten years he'd been in Tokyo.  Even then, the situation wasn't either/or, as she painted it. He asked her to come with him, and it was her that chose, what, her job?  Tokyo? over him. She didn't even give him an ultimatum of a choice, just packed up and left. It seemed to me that she revised things in her mind so that she wasn't the bad guy, as people often do to salvage their self-image as a good person.   I don't even think she was necessarily wrong to not go with him, but the way she did it was really cold.  I guess we'll have to see how she shakes out in future episodes, but I'm definitely of mixed feelings about her right now.   Anyway, I am enjoying the delicious watercolor backgrounds.

I think there's a lack of communication between them for sure, but uprooting your entire life, job, connections, etc. to move halfway across the country with your boyfriend is a big ask. I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.   Perhaps there's MORE of a miscommunication going on with the letter we've seen in flashbacks, perhaps she was expecting to come back and be able to talk it over with him the next day but he left immediately assuming her walking out was a break up. Either way Kanoko is having second thoughts after all.   I personally really like her as a character. There's not an ounce of bitterness between the two characters after breaking up, just some awkwardness, and they all have different priorities in life that they're figuring out how to get straight.

I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.           As I said, it was how she ended it, not that she ended it, that was cold.  Just silently packing her things and then verbally flipping him off with ""I like Western sweets,"" as she walked out, when he believed his family needed him, was pretty harsh no matter what her reasons for not wanting to go were.   Also ""halfway across the country"" is a bit different in Japan, than say, the US.  Tokyo to Kyoto is a five and a half hour drive or 2-4 hours by train, depending on which train. In CA a 2-hr one-way daily commute isn't rare.  So it wouldn't be unreasonable to try long distance for awhile until both of them decided on what they wanted to do, instead of just flat walking out like she did.

She took him for granted expecting him to hang around like a puppy and when he didn't she took it as him ending it. Hence the line of him choosing his family over her, she's just bitter that he betrayed her expectations.  In short she was selfcentered and arrogant.   In the van when talking to him she thought that he would be hopeless without her yet, his doing fine. At the end she was surprised when he remembered the promise and again when he said that she dumped him.    With a bit of luck the experience has tought her some humility.

Maybe it's just over abbreviated. Giving everyone involved a little bit of credit, it's a bit ""mistakes were made"" on both sides.   She had a job, and he just announced he was leaving without consulting her at all (and just assumed she'd come too), which is pretty much the bare minimum you should expect from anyone committed to a relationship. He was also clearly being ridiculous in suggesting only he could carry a business that employs a dozen people and he's not even set foot in for a decade. She however didn't attempt to hear him out, reason with him, or offer any kind of support (though I think she had arrived with the intent of consoling him over the breakup of the band). Just got up and left which is pretty damn cold to a guy clearly in a lot of distress. That said, from what else we've seen of Nagomu, it's reasonable to assume she was dealing with this kind of shit all the time, and possibly just didn't have the patience in the moment to explain to him why he was being a child, yet again, and he needed to take a step back and approach the situation like the adult he supposedly is.    I think if anyone was talking those around them for granted it was Nagomu. Both his parents and Kanoko. He was upset, who wouldn't be to be contacted out of the blue to say your Dad's in hospital, but he was impulsively making some very big decisions that would affect both their lives. That's my read on the ""western sweets"" remark - it's blunt and insensitive, but the emotion is ""how dare you just assume I'd drop everything to come work in your family sweet shop?"". Kanoko could have handled it a hell of a lot better, but I've got some sympathy for the reaction.

Wait ... what? The whole ""in sickness and in health whether richer or poorer"" vow applies to marriage. If they were engaged, fine. If they had been together for a long time and the subject of marriage never came up ... well maybe she just dodged a bullet. Girlfriends and boyfriends are even less obligated to stick around during rough patches than longtime platonic friends are. Particularly if the reason for the boyfriend's being down in the dumps in the first place is ""failed at my (very low percentage of success just as everyone warned me) dream of being a professional musician and now I have absolutely nothing going on for my long term financial future."" Being the boyfriend of the 1 guy in 100 who actually succeeds at being a professional musician? Very cool and worth the risk of sticking around for awhile! Being the boyfriend of the other 99? Not so much. Tell him to catch up with you a couple years down the line after he's maybe finished a vocational program or something, has career prospects lined up and if he's lucky you may actually still be single. Sounds harsh but there is a reason why some guys choose boring reliable things like accounting.

Maybe, but I thought the scene pretty clearly showed him crying over a letter that said that his dad was in the hospital so he needed to come home, he asked her to come with him, and instead she just packed her bags and told him she preferred western sweets before walking out. That may be his misinterpretation of events rather than what actually happened, but it's also the only full perspective we have at this point.

She seemed baffled when he said she dumped her at the festival, and told Itsuka she got dumped by him.

If she wasn't sure she could do long-distance or move to be with him she could have said ""I have to think about this.""   Though with these kind of shows we get to know every central character a lot and they're well rounded and human, so I think there's a lot more to her than what we've seen.

She framed it as ""he chose his family over me,"" which is a rather selfish point of view unless they were engaged or had been together for most of the ten years he'd been in Tokyo.  Even then, the situation wasn't either/or, as she painted it. He asked her to come with him, and it was her that chose, what, her job?  Tokyo? over him. She didn't even give him an ultimatum of a choice, just packed up and left. It seemed to me that she revised things in her mind so that she wasn't the bad guy, as people often do to salvage their self-image as a good person.   I don't even think she was necessarily wrong to not go with him, but the way she did it was really cold.  I guess we'll have to see how she shakes out in future episodes, but I'm definitely of mixed feelings about her right now.   Anyway, I am enjoying the delicious watercolor backgrounds.

I think there's a lack of communication between them for sure, but uprooting your entire life, job, connections, etc. to move halfway across the country with your boyfriend is a big ask. I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.   Perhaps there's MORE of a miscommunication going on with the letter we've seen in flashbacks, perhaps she was expecting to come back and be able to talk it over with him the next day but he left immediately assuming her walking out was a break up. Either way Kanoko is having second thoughts after all.   I personally really like her as a character. There's not an ounce of bitterness between the two characters after breaking up, just some awkwardness, and they all have different priorities in life that they're figuring out how to get straight.

I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.           As I said, it was how she ended it, not that she ended it, that was cold.  Just silently packing her things and then verbally flipping him off with ""I like Western sweets,"" as she walked out, when he believed his family needed him, was pretty harsh no matter what her reasons for not wanting to go were.   Also ""halfway across the country"" is a bit different in Japan, than say, the US.  Tokyo to Kyoto is a five and a half hour drive or 2-4 hours by train, depending on which train. In CA a 2-hr one-way daily commute isn't rare.  So it wouldn't be unreasonable to try long distance for awhile until both of them decided on what they wanted to do, instead of just flat walking out like she did.

She took him for granted expecting him to hang around like a puppy and when he didn't she took it as him ending it. Hence the line of him choosing his family over her, she's just bitter that he betrayed her expectations.  In short she was selfcentered and arrogant.   In the van when talking to him she thought that he would be hopeless without her yet, his doing fine. At the end she was surprised when he remembered the promise and again when he said that she dumped him.    With a bit of luck the experience has tought her some humility.

Maybe it's just over abbreviated. Giving everyone involved a little bit of credit, it's a bit ""mistakes were made"" on both sides.   She had a job, and he just announced he was leaving without consulting her at all (and just assumed she'd come too), which is pretty much the bare minimum you should expect from anyone committed to a relationship. He was also clearly being ridiculous in suggesting only he could carry a business that employs a dozen people and he's not even set foot in for a decade. She however didn't attempt to hear him out, reason with him, or offer any kind of support (though I think she had arrived with the intent of consoling him over the breakup of the band). Just got up and left which is pretty damn cold to a guy clearly in a lot of distress. That said, from what else we've seen of Nagomu, it's reasonable to assume she was dealing with this kind of shit all the time, and possibly just didn't have the patience in the moment to explain to him why he was being a child, yet again, and he needed to take a step back and approach the situation like the adult he supposedly is.    I think if anyone was talking those around them for granted it was Nagomu. Both his parents and Kanoko. He was upset, who wouldn't be to be contacted out of the blue to say your Dad's in hospital, but he was impulsively making some very big decisions that would affect both their lives. That's my read on the ""western sweets"" remark - it's blunt and insensitive, but the emotion is ""how dare you just assume I'd drop everything to come work in your family sweet shop?"". Kanoko could have handled it a hell of a lot better, but I've got some sympathy for the reaction.

Wait ... what? The whole ""in sickness and in health whether richer or poorer"" vow applies to marriage. If they were engaged, fine. If they had been together for a long time and the subject of marriage never came up ... well maybe she just dodged a bullet. Girlfriends and boyfriends are even less obligated to stick around during rough patches than longtime platonic friends are. Particularly if the reason for the boyfriend's being down in the dumps in the first place is ""failed at my (very low percentage of success just as everyone warned me) dream of being a professional musician and now I have absolutely nothing going on for my long term financial future."" Being the boyfriend of the 1 guy in 100 who actually succeeds at being a professional musician? Very cool and worth the risk of sticking around for awhile! Being the boyfriend of the other 99? Not so much. Tell him to catch up with you a couple years down the line after he's maybe finished a vocational program or something, has career prospects lined up and if he's lucky you may actually still be single. Sounds harsh but there is a reason why some guys choose boring reliable things like accounting.

Maybe, but I thought the scene pretty clearly showed him crying over a letter that said that his dad was in the hospital so he needed to come home, he asked her to come with him, and instead she just packed her bags and told him she preferred western sweets before walking out. That may be his misinterpretation of events rather than what actually happened, but it's also the only full perspective we have at this point.

She seemed baffled when he said she dumped her at the festival, and told Itsuka she got dumped by him.

If she wasn't sure she could do long-distance or move to be with him she could have said ""I have to think about this.""   Though with these kind of shows we get to know every central character a lot and they're well rounded and human, so I think there's a lot more to her than what we've seen.

She framed it as ""he chose his family over me,"" which is a rather selfish point of view unless they were engaged or had been together for most of the ten years he'd been in Tokyo.  Even then, the situation wasn't either/or, as she painted it. He asked her to come with him, and it was her that chose, what, her job?  Tokyo? over him. She didn't even give him an ultimatum of a choice, just packed up and left. It seemed to me that she revised things in her mind so that she wasn't the bad guy, as people often do to salvage their self-image as a good person.   I don't even think she was necessarily wrong to not go with him, but the way she did it was really cold.  I guess we'll have to see how she shakes out in future episodes, but I'm definitely of mixed feelings about her right now.   Anyway, I am enjoying the delicious watercolor backgrounds.

I think there's a lack of communication between them for sure, but uprooting your entire life, job, connections, etc. to move halfway across the country with your boyfriend is a big ask. I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.   Perhaps there's MORE of a miscommunication going on with the letter we've seen in flashbacks, perhaps she was expecting to come back and be able to talk it over with him the next day but he left immediately assuming her walking out was a break up. Either way Kanoko is having second thoughts after all.   I personally really like her as a character. There's not an ounce of bitterness between the two characters after breaking up, just some awkwardness, and they all have different priorities in life that they're figuring out how to get straight.

I don't think it's cold or even unreasonable for a couple to split over that.           As I said, it was how she ended it, not that she ended it, that was cold.  Just silently packing her things and then verbally flipping him off with ""I like Western sweets,"" as she walked out, when he believed his family needed him, was pretty harsh no matter what her reasons for not wanting to go were.   Also ""halfway across the country"" is a bit different in Japan, than say, the US.  Tokyo to Kyoto is a five and a half hour drive or 2-4 hours by train, depending on which train. In CA a 2-hr one-way daily commute isn't rare.  So it wouldn't be unreasonable to try long distance for awhile until both of them decided on what they wanted to do, instead of just flat walking out like she did.

She took him for granted expecting him to hang around like a puppy and when he didn't she took it as him ending it. Hence the line of him choosing his family over her, she's just bitter that he betrayed her expectations.  In short she was selfcentered and arrogant.   In the van when talking to him she thought that he would be hopeless without her yet, his doing fine. At the end she was surprised when he remembered the promise and again when he said that she dumped him.    With a bit of luck the experience has tought her some humility.

Maybe it's just over abbreviated. Giving everyone involved a little bit of credit, it's a bit ""mistakes were made"" on both sides.   She had a job, and he just announced he was leaving without consulting her at all (and just assumed she'd come too), which is pretty much the bare minimum you should expect from anyone committed to a relationship. He was also clearly being ridiculous in suggesting only he could carry a business that employs a dozen people and he's not even set foot in for a decade. She however didn't attempt to hear him out, reason with him, or offer any kind of support (though I think she had arrived with the intent of consoling him over the breakup of the band). Just got up and left which is pretty damn cold to a guy clearly in a lot of distress. That said, from what else we've seen of Nagomu, it's reasonable to assume she was dealing with this kind of shit all the time, and possibly just didn't have the patience in the moment to explain to him why he was being a child, yet again, and he needed to take a step back and approach the situation like the adult he supposedly is.    I think if anyone was talking those around them for granted it was Nagomu. Both his parents and Kanoko. He was upset, who wouldn't be to be contacted out of the blue to say your Dad's in hospital, but he was impulsively making some very big decisions that would affect both their lives. That's my read on the ""western sweets"" remark - it's blunt and insensitive, but the emotion is ""how dare you just assume I'd drop everything to come work in your family sweet shop?"". Kanoko could have handled it a hell of a lot better, but I've got some sympathy for the reaction.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world.

I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.

Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim (Ys 6), the cult classic JRPG and sixth installment of the Ys series is making its way to mobile platforms (Ys 6 Mobile) in Malaysia with an Open Beta starting 6 May 2022.   The port of the highly rated 2003 console JRPG made its mobile debut in Japan in July 2021 and soon thereafter entered the Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong markets topping the charts in both the iOS and Android app stores accumulating over 3 million downloads thus far.

Ys 6 was the sixth entry in a 35-year-old RPG series. This is a game that won so many hearts close to 2-decades ago when it was first released on PC and consoles. The fascinating story, loveable characters and enticing gameplay made it a classic. Now we are excited to allow fans and newcomers alike the chance to experience the vast and wonderful world of Ys,” said VNG Games studio.   “We were even more motivated ever since we witnessed the overwhelmingly positive feedback when Ys 6 was first launched in the other regions. For many players out there, Ys could have been a childhood memory and it is our pleasure to allow them the opportunity to revisit the experience of journeying across this beautiful JRPG,” the studio added.  In anticipation of this much-awaited debut, the publisher - VNG Games, has announced a pre-registration initiative from now to 5 May, accessible at: https://ys6.vnggames.com/sgmy/say-yes.

Adventurers will play alongside Adol, a world-famous adventurer who has penned thousands of travelog volumes, and his pet companion. After an attack launched by a fleet of Romun ships, Adol finds himself on the Canaan Islands by the daughters of the chieftain of the nearby Rehda village.

Now we are excited to allow fans and newcomers alike the chance to experience the vast and wonderful world of Ys,” said VNG Games studio.   “We were even more motivated ever since we witnessed the overwhelmingly positive feedback when Ys 6 was first launched in the other regions.

The fascinating story, loveable characters and enticing gameplay made it a classic. Now we are excited to allow fans and newcomers alike the chance to experience the vast and wonderful world of Ys,” said VNG Games studio.   “We were even more motivated ever since we witnessed the overwhelmingly positive feedback when Ys 6 was first launched in the other regions. For many players out there, Ys could have been a childhood memory and it is our pleasure to allow them the opportunity to revisit the experience of journeying across this beautiful JRPG,” the studio added.

The port of the highly rated 2003 console JRPG made its mobile debut in Japan in July 2021 and soon thereafter entered the Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong markets topping the charts in both the iOS and Android app stores accumulating over 3 million downloads thus far. Riding the wave of success, the game now makes its way to Malaysian shores. Players in Malaysia will finally get to experience Ys 6 Mobile, widely acclaimed as one of the most anticipated JRPG Mobile Titles of The Year.  “We at VNG Games, are delighted to announce that we are bringing the Ys 6 Mobile to Malaysia. Ys 6 was the sixth entry in a 35-year-old RPG series. This is a game that won so many hearts close to 2-decades ago when it was first released on PC and consoles. The fascinating story, loveable characters and enticing gameplay made it a classic. Now we are excited to allow fans and newcomers alike the chance to experience the vast and wonderful world of Ys,” said VNG Games studio.   “We were even more motivated ever since we witnessed the overwhelmingly positive feedback when Ys 6 was first launched in the other regions. For many players out there, Ys could have been a childhood memory and it is our pleasure to allow them the opportunity to revisit the experience of journeying across this beautiful JRPG,” the studio added.  In anticipation of this much-awaited debut, the publisher - VNG Games, has announced a pre-registration initiative from now to 5 May, accessible at: https://ys6.vnggames.com/sgmy/say-yes.

Adventurers will play alongside Adol, a world-famous adventurer who has penned thousands of travelog volumes, and his pet companion. After an attack launched by a fleet of Romun ships, Adol finds himself on the Canaan Islands by the daughters of the chieftain of the nearby Rehda village. It is from here that the adventure and story in Ys 6 Mobile begins to unfold.

Whether it be a brutal warrior, agile ranger, stealthy samurai, clinical assassin,  or a spellbinding mage, players are given the flexibility to pick the role they want.

Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!

Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

I just picked up the Sentai BDs cheap to replace the old ADV metal box like three months ago. Guess it'll be time to upgrade again soon.   I hope this release includes the shorts, which were missing from all previous US releases, and the movie, which, while terrible, hasn't been in any previous box-set release (ADV released it separately, but it wasn't in their metal thin-pak set).

It's a great series, you just need to go in knowing that about 25% of the series is incredibly bad and should be avoided [the Africa and island arcs].

The only way I'd double-dip on this title is if they included special features not on the Sentai release--an inclusion of the Miho Morikawa music video for the OP song would certainly be enticing. And if even this release precludes the movie, trust anyone who says that nobody is missing anything with it, not even if you're a completist.

This. The movie is 1/3 incomprehensible recap of the tv series and 2/3 some of the worst plot and animation I've ever seen. I found it even worse than the island/Africa arc   I'd still like for it to be included though, just to make the release feel more complete      Back to top                  iamthevastuniverse    Joined: 11 Nov 2010 		    Posts: 994       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:45 pm              Angel M Cazares wrote:    I wonder if GKIDS is going to produce a new English dub.

The real question should be if the old Streamline dub will finally get included. For those unfamiliar, ADV's dub for Nadia wasn't the original, but rather it was one produced by Streamline that covered the first 8 episodes & was only released on VHS & LD.

But I don't think it likely they will redub Nadia.  The reason Evangelion was redubbed was because of Anno's dissatisfaction with Funimation's dub of the Rebuild movies and Anno wanted more stricter oversight over the dub.  As far as I know, Anno hasn't voiced any displeasure with the ADV dub of Nadia, so it should be fine to be included.  I watched Nadia for the first time a few years ago and I really enjoyed it and it quickly became one of my favorite Anno titles.  I just skipped the filler in episodes and I had a pretty enjoyable time with the show.  Other than two episodes of the island arc, you can pretty much skip it and not miss anything important.  The ADV dub of Nadia was terrific and I loved all the performances of it.  I can't wait to own this release.

I'd easily double dip for that. Otherwise if it's still just regularly blu-ray I'll be curious to see comparison between this and the recent Sentai blu-ray since I bought that day 1.

Guess it'll be time to upgrade again soon.   I hope this release includes the shorts, which were missing from all previous US releases, and the movie, which, while terrible, hasn't been in any previous box-set release (ADV released it separately, but it wasn't in their metal thin-pak set).         The movie was actually included in the second collection set which was released in 2004 and again in 2008, but without the CDs.  release#2836  https://imgs.dvdempire.com/product/500/607176b/nadia-the-secret-of-blue-water-collection-2-cd-back-cover-art.jpg  release#12849  https://imgs.dvdempire.com/product/500/1432147b/nadia-secret-of-blue-water-collection-2-back-cover-art.jpg      Back to top                   Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

I just picked up the Sentai BDs cheap to replace the old ADV metal box like three months ago. Guess it'll be time to upgrade again soon.   I hope this release includes the shorts, which were missing from all previous US releases, and the movie, which, while terrible, hasn't been in any previous box-set release (ADV released it separately, but it wasn't in their metal thin-pak set).

Those would make it worthwhile to consider this new set.

Maybe that's a new definition for what makes a series a ""classic"".            It's a great series, you just need to go in knowing that about 25% of the series is incredibly bad and should be avoided [the Africa and island arcs].

Unless the original English audio is lost, why bother? All things considered the English dub has aged remarkably well.   The only way I'd double-dip on this title is if they included special features not on the Sentai release--an inclusion of the Miho Morikawa music video for the OP song would certainly be enticing. And if even this release precludes the movie, trust anyone who says that nobody is missing anything with it, not even if you're a completist.

This. The movie is 1/3 incomprehensible recap of the tv series and 2/3 some of the worst plot and animation I've ever seen. I found it even worse than the island/Africa arc   I'd still like for it to be included though, just to make the release feel more complete      Back to top                  iamthevastuniverse    Joined: 11 Nov 2010 		    Posts: 994       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:45 pm              Angel M Cazares wrote:    I wonder if GKIDS is going to produce a new English dub.            A new dub is completely unnecessary its not a perfect dub but its certainly competent. The only way I would be down for a new dub if the casting wasn't a predictable affair. I may buy this release time will tell.

The real question should be if the old Streamline dub will finally get included. For those unfamiliar, ADV's dub for Nadia wasn't the original, but rather it was one produced by Streamline that covered the first 8 episodes & was only released on VHS & LD.

Stupid me forgot that the new Evangelion series dub was comissioned by Netflix, not GKIDS.

But I don't think it likely they will redub Nadia.  The reason Evangelion was redubbed was because of Anno's dissatisfaction with Funimation's dub of the Rebuild movies and Anno wanted more stricter oversight over the dub.  As far as I know, Anno hasn't voiced any displeasure with the ADV dub of Nadia, so it should be fine to be included.  I watched Nadia for the first time a few years ago and I really enjoyed it and it quickly became one of my favorite Anno titles.  I just skipped the filler in episodes and I had a pretty enjoyable time with the show.  Other than two episodes of the island arc, you can pretty much skip it and not miss anything important.  The ADV dub of Nadia was terrific and I loved all the performances of it.  I can't wait to own this release.

I'd easily double dip for that. Otherwise if it's still just regularly blu-ray I'll be curious to see comparison between this and the recent Sentai blu-ray since I bought that day 1.

Maybe that's a new definition for what makes a series a ""classic"".            It's a great series, you just need to go in knowing that about 25% of the series is incredibly bad and should be avoided [the Africa and island arcs].

Unless the original English audio is lost, why bother? All things considered the English dub has aged remarkably well.   The only way I'd double-dip on this title is if they included special features not on the Sentai release--an inclusion of the Miho Morikawa music video for the OP song would certainly be enticing. And if even this release precludes the movie, trust anyone who says that nobody is missing anything with it, not even if you're a completist.

This. The movie is 1/3 incomprehensible recap of the tv series and 2/3 some of the worst plot and animation I've ever seen. I found it even worse than the island/Africa arc   I'd still like for it to be included though, just to make the release feel more complete      Back to top                  iamthevastuniverse    Joined: 11 Nov 2010 		    Posts: 994       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:45 pm              Angel M Cazares wrote:    I wonder if GKIDS is going to produce a new English dub.

The real question should be if the old Streamline dub will finally get included. For those unfamiliar, ADV's dub for Nadia wasn't the original, but rather it was one produced by Streamline that covered the first 8 episodes & was only released on VHS & LD.

But I don't think it likely they will redub Nadia.  The reason Evangelion was redubbed was because of Anno's dissatisfaction with Funimation's dub of the Rebuild movies and Anno wanted more stricter oversight over the dub.  As far as I know, Anno hasn't voiced any displeasure with the ADV dub of Nadia, so it should be fine to be included.  I watched Nadia for the first time a few years ago and I really enjoyed it and it quickly became one of my favorite Anno titles.  I just skipped the filler in episodes and I had a pretty enjoyable time with the show.  Other than two episodes of the island arc, you can pretty much skip it and not miss anything important.  The ADV dub of Nadia was terrific and I loved all the performances of it.  I can't wait to own this release.

I'd easily double dip for that. Otherwise if it's still just regularly blu-ray I'll be curious to see comparison between this and the recent Sentai blu-ray since I bought that day 1.

Maybe that's a new definition for what makes a series a ""classic"".            It's a great series, you just need to go in knowing that about 25% of the series is incredibly bad and should be avoided [the Africa and island arcs].

The only way I'd double-dip on this title is if they included special features not on the Sentai release--an inclusion of the Miho Morikawa music video for the OP song would certainly be enticing. And if even this release precludes the movie, trust anyone who says that nobody is missing anything with it, not even if you're a completist.

This. The movie is 1/3 incomprehensible recap of the tv series and 2/3 some of the worst plot and animation I've ever seen. I found it even worse than the island/Africa arc   I'd still like for it to be included though, just to make the release feel more complete      Back to top                  iamthevastuniverse    Joined: 11 Nov 2010 		    Posts: 994       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:45 pm              Angel M Cazares wrote:    I wonder if GKIDS is going to produce a new English dub.

The real question should be if the old Streamline dub will finally get included. For those unfamiliar, ADV's dub for Nadia wasn't the original, but rather it was one produced by Streamline that covered the first 8 episodes & was only released on VHS & LD.

But I don't think it likely they will redub Nadia.  The reason Evangelion was redubbed was because of Anno's dissatisfaction with Funimation's dub of the Rebuild movies and Anno wanted more stricter oversight over the dub.  As far as I know, Anno hasn't voiced any displeasure with the ADV dub of Nadia, so it should be fine to be included.  I watched Nadia for the first time a few years ago and I really enjoyed it and it quickly became one of my favorite Anno titles.  I just skipped the filler in episodes and I had a pretty enjoyable time with the show.  Other than two episodes of the island arc, you can pretty much skip it and not miss anything important.  The ADV dub of Nadia was terrific and I loved all the performances of it.  I can't wait to own this release.

I'd easily double dip for that. Otherwise if it's still just regularly blu-ray I'll be curious to see comparison between this and the recent Sentai blu-ray since I bought that day 1.

Guess it'll be time to upgrade again soon.   I hope this release includes the shorts, which were missing from all previous US releases, and the movie, which, while terrible, hasn't been in any previous box-set release (ADV released it separately, but it wasn't in their metal thin-pak set).         The movie was actually included in the second collection set which was released in 2004 and again in 2008, but without the CDs.  release#2836  https://imgs.dvdempire.com/product/500/607176b/nadia-the-secret-of-blue-water-collection-2-cd-back-cover-art.jpg  release#12849  https://imgs.dvdempire.com/product/500/1432147b/nadia-secret-of-blue-water-collection-2-back-cover-art.jpg      Back to top                   Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

With double the runtime we'll probably get the same amount of content as the second season again, if they decide to do more than one cour (which seems unlikely, but isn't completely out of the window), we might even get to see more. Gonna be interesting to see how they will adapt it, given that Koharu was actually introduced around the point where the content of season two ended and would have been around the cast for quite some time by now.

Bummer that the first 4 episodes are retreads of old episodes, but maybe it is to set up the last 8 in style, we might be going after Fuji-san again?   Looking forward to this, one of my favorite short animes, glad to have it long.

Happy to have a new season and at full length episodes.    The first four episodes being compilations is odd, but from my understanding the anime doesn't follow the manga 1:1. For instance Koharu, the new girl being introduced, apparently should have showed up much earlier (Season 2 I think). So if the ""short stories"" being added in is to accommodate missing chapters, I think it'll work.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting.

For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.

And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.
