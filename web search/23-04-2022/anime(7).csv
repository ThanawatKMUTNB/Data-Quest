The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by James Beckett, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4             I knew absolutely nothing about The Demon Girl Next Door when I happened upon its 2nd season premiere for this Spring's Preview Guide, but boy did it make  one heck of an impression. Despite my complete lack of context and background knowledge, I was able to immediately jive with the show's adorable aesthetic and equally loveable cast. It helped a ton that the show's character writing and joke-craft was shockingly precise and efficient, meaning that I was able to learn pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the series simply by following along and laughing along with the cast.  Between then and now, though, I knew I'd probably have to catch up on the first series if I was going to do a proper job of reviewing its sequel, and while I didn't have time to watch every episode of the anime, I was able to binge the first two volumes of the manga, which just so happens to coincide with everything that (I assume) got covered in Season 1. I'm really glad I did, too, because Episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door's second season features a lot of backstory and payoff that I definitely wouldn't have appreciated if I hadn't taken the time to get to know Shamiko, Momo, Mikan, and the rest of the gang more properly.  When Mikan arrived on the scene and DGND started delving more into the complicated history that Momo's stepsister Sakura shares with Shamiko's family, I knew that we were bound to get a deeper dive into the magical girls' background, and that's where a lot of the focus lies in “Urban Exploration! The Troubled Mikan and the Excited Demon”. Sure, it's mostly a character-focused exploration, giving us a glimpse at how Mikan met Momo and got roped into the world of magical girls herself, but it's a compelling one. One of the things I've come to love about DGND is how it can so casually lay out the more complex and serious elements of its lore without ever losing sight of its breezy tone. If you actually sit down and consider Mikan's backstory for a bit, it's honestly a bit heartbreaking: Her father made a desperate wish to save their family's factory (the same one where Daddy-Box's current vessel was made), and it ended up ruining his daughter's life. Poor little Mikan was so scared of her misfortune curse, and what it could possibly do to the ones that she loved; it wasn't until an equally little (and adorable) Momo came to save her that Mikan was able to see a way out of her predicament.  It's the exact kind of melodramatic fantasy that you'd expect to play out in any typical magical girl anime, but since this is The Demon Girl Next Door, that means we also get to balance out the melancholy with Shamiko finding a magic fork in the dirt that she is just soexcited to have. Well, okay, it's not technically a magic fork (though it still serves as a great payoff to the very first episode of season one, when Shamiko literally used a fork as her primary weapon against her “arch rival” Momo). Rather, it's an ancient and powerful artifact that once belonged to Joshua, aka Daddy-Box, and Shamiko's mother very helpfully clarifies that the Whatchamacallit Wand can be any vaguely cylindrical device that its wielder can imagine: a fork, a infinite-ammo rocket launcher, a larger fork, a laundry rack. you name it!  So, not only do we have even more tidbits of demon and magical girl lore to chew on, but Shamiko now has an ungodly powerful weapon that she can use to fulfill her ultimate destiny: That of a prop comedian. So what if her first ever bit goes down like the Hindenberg in front of all of her friends? Like the narrator reminds us, comedy is more about confidence and timing than it is about the actual quality of the jokes. That might not be true all of the time, but The Demon Girl Next Door has confidence and timing to spare, and its jokes are pretty good, too, so I feel like this show is going to be one of the big winners of the season.  Rating:               Odds and Ends  • We got a cute check-in with Anri and Ogura, too, and the girls actually play pretty well off of each other, though even Shamiko assures us that it will be the “first and last time” that the show indulges the two with their own show-within-a-show.   • One of my favorite running gags of this series is how Shamiko's mother's go-to solution for all of life's problems is just to get embarrassingly drunk and mess around with her cardboard-box husband. That's hashtag relatable, I'll tell you what.   • Another great running gag is how amazingly intelligent and capable Ryo is, considering who she is related to. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the show depicting her as the one who could really take over the world with dark magic…if she ever wanted to.   • I mentioned the show's Big Gay Energy a bit in my preview guide coverage, but Shamiko's desire to make Momo laugh again has only sealed the deal on the ship. Plus, reading the manga has made the joke about Shamiko trying to recruit Momo as her “vassal” hit a lot harder. Join the forces of Darkness, Momo! They have much better food, at the very least!

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by James Beckett, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4             I knew absolutely nothing about The Demon Girl Next Door when I happened upon its 2nd season premiere for this Spring's Preview Guide, but boy did it make  one heck of an impression. Despite my complete lack of context and background knowledge, I was able to immediately jive with the show's adorable aesthetic and equally loveable cast. It helped a ton that the show's character writing and joke-craft was shockingly precise and efficient, meaning that I was able to learn pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the series simply by following along and laughing along with the cast.  Between then and now, though, I knew I'd probably have to catch up on the first series if I was going to do a proper job of reviewing its sequel, and while I didn't have time to watch every episode of the anime, I was able to binge the first two volumes of the manga, which just so happens to coincide with everything that (I assume) got covered in Season 1. I'm really glad I did, too, because Episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door's second season features a lot of backstory and payoff that I definitely wouldn't have appreciated if I hadn't taken the time to get to know Shamiko, Momo, Mikan, and the rest of the gang more properly.  When Mikan arrived on the scene and DGND started delving more into the complicated history that Momo's stepsister Sakura shares with Shamiko's family, I knew that we were bound to get a deeper dive into the magical girls' background, and that's where a lot of the focus lies in “Urban Exploration! The Troubled Mikan and the Excited Demon”. Sure, it's mostly a character-focused exploration, giving us a glimpse at how Mikan met Momo and got roped into the world of magical girls herself, but it's a compelling one. One of the things I've come to love about DGND is how it can so casually lay out the more complex and serious elements of its lore without ever losing sight of its breezy tone. If you actually sit down and consider Mikan's backstory for a bit, it's honestly a bit heartbreaking: Her father made a desperate wish to save their family's factory (the same one where Daddy-Box's current vessel was made), and it ended up ruining his daughter's life. Poor little Mikan was so scared of her misfortune curse, and what it could possibly do to the ones that she loved; it wasn't until an equally little (and adorable) Momo came to save her that Mikan was able to see a way out of her predicament.  It's the exact kind of melodramatic fantasy that you'd expect to play out in any typical magical girl anime, but since this is The Demon Girl Next Door, that means we also get to balance out the melancholy with Shamiko finding a magic fork in the dirt that she is just soexcited to have. Well, okay, it's not technically a magic fork (though it still serves as a great payoff to the very first episode of season one, when Shamiko literally used a fork as her primary weapon against her “arch rival” Momo). Rather, it's an ancient and powerful artifact that once belonged to Joshua, aka Daddy-Box, and Shamiko's mother very helpfully clarifies that the Whatchamacallit Wand can be any vaguely cylindrical device that its wielder can imagine: a fork, a infinite-ammo rocket launcher, a larger fork, a laundry rack. you name it!  So, not only do we have even more tidbits of demon and magical girl lore to chew on, but Shamiko now has an ungodly powerful weapon that she can use to fulfill her ultimate destiny: That of a prop comedian. So what if her first ever bit goes down like the Hindenberg in front of all of her friends? Like the narrator reminds us, comedy is more about confidence and timing than it is about the actual quality of the jokes. That might not be true all of the time, but The Demon Girl Next Door has confidence and timing to spare, and its jokes are pretty good, too, so I feel like this show is going to be one of the big winners of the season.  Rating:               Odds and Ends  • We got a cute check-in with Anri and Ogura, too, and the girls actually play pretty well off of each other, though even Shamiko assures us that it will be the “first and last time” that the show indulges the two with their own show-within-a-show.   • One of my favorite running gags of this series is how Shamiko's mother's go-to solution for all of life's problems is just to get embarrassingly drunk and mess around with her cardboard-box husband. That's hashtag relatable, I'll tell you what.   • Another great running gag is how amazingly intelligent and capable Ryo is, considering who she is related to. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the show depicting her as the one who could really take over the world with dark magic…if she ever wanted to.   • I mentioned the show's Big Gay Energy a bit in my preview guide coverage, but Shamiko's desire to make Momo laugh again has only sealed the deal on the ship. Plus, reading the manga has made the joke about Shamiko trying to recruit Momo as her “vassal” hit a lot harder. Join the forces of Darkness, Momo! They have much better food, at the very least!

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by James Beckett, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4             I knew absolutely nothing about The Demon Girl Next Door when I happened upon its 2nd season premiere for this Spring's Preview Guide, but boy did it make  one heck of an impression. Despite my complete lack of context and background knowledge, I was able to immediately jive with the show's adorable aesthetic and equally loveable cast. It helped a ton that the show's character writing and joke-craft was shockingly precise and efficient, meaning that I was able to learn pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the series simply by following along and laughing along with the cast.  Between then and now, though, I knew I'd probably have to catch up on the first series if I was going to do a proper job of reviewing its sequel, and while I didn't have time to watch every episode of the anime, I was able to binge the first two volumes of the manga, which just so happens to coincide with everything that (I assume) got covered in Season 1. I'm really glad I did, too, because Episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door's second season features a lot of backstory and payoff that I definitely wouldn't have appreciated if I hadn't taken the time to get to know Shamiko, Momo, Mikan, and the rest of the gang more properly.  When Mikan arrived on the scene and DGND started delving more into the complicated history that Momo's stepsister Sakura shares with Shamiko's family, I knew that we were bound to get a deeper dive into the magical girls' background, and that's where a lot of the focus lies in “Urban Exploration! The Troubled Mikan and the Excited Demon”. Sure, it's mostly a character-focused exploration, giving us a glimpse at how Mikan met Momo and got roped into the world of magical girls herself, but it's a compelling one. One of the things I've come to love about DGND is how it can so casually lay out the more complex and serious elements of its lore without ever losing sight of its breezy tone. If you actually sit down and consider Mikan's backstory for a bit, it's honestly a bit heartbreaking: Her father made a desperate wish to save their family's factory (the same one where Daddy-Box's current vessel was made), and it ended up ruining his daughter's life. Poor little Mikan was so scared of her misfortune curse, and what it could possibly do to the ones that she loved; it wasn't until an equally little (and adorable) Momo came to save her that Mikan was able to see a way out of her predicament.  It's the exact kind of melodramatic fantasy that you'd expect to play out in any typical magical girl anime, but since this is The Demon Girl Next Door, that means we also get to balance out the melancholy with Shamiko finding a magic fork in the dirt that she is just soexcited to have. Well, okay, it's not technically a magic fork (though it still serves as a great payoff to the very first episode of season one, when Shamiko literally used a fork as her primary weapon against her “arch rival” Momo). Rather, it's an ancient and powerful artifact that once belonged to Joshua, aka Daddy-Box, and Shamiko's mother very helpfully clarifies that the Whatchamacallit Wand can be any vaguely cylindrical device that its wielder can imagine: a fork, a infinite-ammo rocket launcher, a larger fork, a laundry rack. you name it!  So, not only do we have even more tidbits of demon and magical girl lore to chew on, but Shamiko now has an ungodly powerful weapon that she can use to fulfill her ultimate destiny: That of a prop comedian. So what if her first ever bit goes down like the Hindenberg in front of all of her friends? Like the narrator reminds us, comedy is more about confidence and timing than it is about the actual quality of the jokes. That might not be true all of the time, but The Demon Girl Next Door has confidence and timing to spare, and its jokes are pretty good, too, so I feel like this show is going to be one of the big winners of the season.  Rating:               Odds and Ends  • We got a cute check-in with Anri and Ogura, too, and the girls actually play pretty well off of each other, though even Shamiko assures us that it will be the “first and last time” that the show indulges the two with their own show-within-a-show.   • One of my favorite running gags of this series is how Shamiko's mother's go-to solution for all of life's problems is just to get embarrassingly drunk and mess around with her cardboard-box husband. That's hashtag relatable, I'll tell you what.   • Another great running gag is how amazingly intelligent and capable Ryo is, considering who she is related to. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the show depicting her as the one who could really take over the world with dark magic…if she ever wanted to.   • I mentioned the show's Big Gay Energy a bit in my preview guide coverage, but Shamiko's desire to make Momo laugh again has only sealed the deal on the ship. Plus, reading the manga has made the joke about Shamiko trying to recruit Momo as her “vassal” hit a lot harder. Join the forces of Darkness, Momo! They have much better food, at the very least!

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episodes 1-2  by James Beckett, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4             I knew absolutely nothing about The Demon Girl Next Door when I happened upon its 2nd season premiere for this Spring's Preview Guide, but boy did it make  one heck of an impression. Despite my complete lack of context and background knowledge, I was able to immediately jive with the show's adorable aesthetic and equally loveable cast. It helped a ton that the show's character writing and joke-craft was shockingly precise and efficient, meaning that I was able to learn pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the series simply by following along and laughing along with the cast.  Between then and now, though, I knew I'd probably have to catch up on the first series if I was going to do a proper job of reviewing its sequel, and while I didn't have time to watch every episode of the anime, I was able to binge the first two volumes of the manga, which just so happens to coincide with everything that (I assume) got covered in Season 1. I'm really glad I did, too, because Episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door's second season features a lot of backstory and payoff that I definitely wouldn't have appreciated if I hadn't taken the time to get to know Shamiko, Momo, Mikan, and the rest of the gang more properly.  When Mikan arrived on the scene and DGND started delving more into the complicated history that Momo's stepsister Sakura shares with Shamiko's family, I knew that we were bound to get a deeper dive into the magical girls' background, and that's where a lot of the focus lies in “Urban Exploration! The Troubled Mikan and the Excited Demon”. Sure, it's mostly a character-focused exploration, giving us a glimpse at how Mikan met Momo and got roped into the world of magical girls herself, but it's a compelling one. One of the things I've come to love about DGND is how it can so casually lay out the more complex and serious elements of its lore without ever losing sight of its breezy tone. If you actually sit down and consider Mikan's backstory for a bit, it's honestly a bit heartbreaking: Her father made a desperate wish to save their family's factory (the same one where Daddy-Box's current vessel was made), and it ended up ruining his daughter's life. Poor little Mikan was so scared of her misfortune curse, and what it could possibly do to the ones that she loved; it wasn't until an equally little (and adorable) Momo came to save her that Mikan was able to see a way out of her predicament.  It's the exact kind of melodramatic fantasy that you'd expect to play out in any typical magical girl anime, but since this is The Demon Girl Next Door, that means we also get to balance out the melancholy with Shamiko finding a magic fork in the dirt that she is just soexcited to have. Well, okay, it's not technically a magic fork (though it still serves as a great payoff to the very first episode of season one, when Shamiko literally used a fork as her primary weapon against her “arch rival” Momo). Rather, it's an ancient and powerful artifact that once belonged to Joshua, aka Daddy-Box, and Shamiko's mother very helpfully clarifies that the Whatchamacallit Wand can be any vaguely cylindrical device that its wielder can imagine: a fork, a infinite-ammo rocket launcher, a larger fork, a laundry rack. you name it!  So, not only do we have even more tidbits of demon and magical girl lore to chew on, but Shamiko now has an ungodly powerful weapon that she can use to fulfill her ultimate destiny: That of a prop comedian. So what if her first ever bit goes down like the Hindenberg in front of all of her friends? Like the narrator reminds us, comedy is more about confidence and timing than it is about the actual quality of the jokes. That might not be true all of the time, but The Demon Girl Next Door has confidence and timing to spare, and its jokes are pretty good, too, so I feel like this show is going to be one of the big winners of the season.  Rating:               Odds and Ends  • We got a cute check-in with Anri and Ogura, too, and the girls actually play pretty well off of each other, though even Shamiko assures us that it will be the “first and last time” that the show indulges the two with their own show-within-a-show.   • One of my favorite running gags of this series is how Shamiko's mother's go-to solution for all of life's problems is just to get embarrassingly drunk and mess around with her cardboard-box husband. That's hashtag relatable, I'll tell you what.   • Another great running gag is how amazingly intelligent and capable Ryo is, considering who she is related to. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the show depicting her as the one who could really take over the world with dark magic…if she ever wanted to.   • I mentioned the show's Big Gay Energy a bit in my preview guide coverage, but Shamiko's desire to make Momo laugh again has only sealed the deal on the ship. Plus, reading the manga has made the joke about Shamiko trying to recruit Momo as her “vassal” hit a lot harder. Join the forces of Darkness, Momo! They have much better food, at the very least!

Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4             I knew absolutely nothing about The Demon Girl Next Door when I happened upon its 2nd season premiere for this Spring's Preview Guide, but boy did it make  one heck of an impression. Despite my complete lack of context and background knowledge, I was able to immediately jive with the show's adorable aesthetic and equally loveable cast. It helped a ton that the show's character writing and joke-craft was shockingly precise and efficient, meaning that I was able to learn pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the series simply by following along and laughing along with the cast.  Between then and now, though, I knew I'd probably have to catch up on the first series if I was going to do a proper job of reviewing its sequel, and while I didn't have time to watch every episode of the anime, I was able to binge the first two volumes of the manga, which just so happens to coincide with everything that (I assume) got covered in Season 1. I'm really glad I did, too, because Episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door's second season features a lot of backstory and payoff that I definitely wouldn't have appreciated if I hadn't taken the time to get to know Shamiko, Momo, Mikan, and the rest of the gang more properly.  When Mikan arrived on the scene and DGND started delving more into the complicated history that Momo's stepsister Sakura shares with Shamiko's family, I knew that we were bound to get a deeper dive into the magical girls' background, and that's where a lot of the focus lies in “Urban Exploration! The Troubled Mikan and the Excited Demon”. Sure, it's mostly a character-focused exploration, giving us a glimpse at how Mikan met Momo and got roped into the world of magical girls herself, but it's a compelling one. One of the things I've come to love about DGND is how it can so casually lay out the more complex and serious elements of its lore without ever losing sight of its breezy tone. If you actually sit down and consider Mikan's backstory for a bit, it's honestly a bit heartbreaking: Her father made a desperate wish to save their family's factory (the same one where Daddy-Box's current vessel was made), and it ended up ruining his daughter's life. Poor little Mikan was so scared of her misfortune curse, and what it could possibly do to the ones that she loved; it wasn't until an equally little (and adorable) Momo came to save her that Mikan was able to see a way out of her predicament.  It's the exact kind of melodramatic fantasy that you'd expect to play out in any typical magical girl anime, but since this is The Demon Girl Next Door, that means we also get to balance out the melancholy with Shamiko finding a magic fork in the dirt that she is just soexcited to have. Well, okay, it's not technically a magic fork (though it still serves as a great payoff to the very first episode of season one, when Shamiko literally used a fork as her primary weapon against her “arch rival” Momo). Rather, it's an ancient and powerful artifact that once belonged to Joshua, aka Daddy-Box, and Shamiko's mother very helpfully clarifies that the Whatchamacallit Wand can be any vaguely cylindrical device that its wielder can imagine: a fork, a infinite-ammo rocket launcher, a larger fork, a laundry rack. you name it!  So, not only do we have even more tidbits of demon and magical girl lore to chew on, but Shamiko now has an ungodly powerful weapon that she can use to fulfill her ultimate destiny: That of a prop comedian. So what if her first ever bit goes down like the Hindenberg in front of all of her friends? Like the narrator reminds us, comedy is more about confidence and timing than it is about the actual quality of the jokes. That might not be true all of the time, but The Demon Girl Next Door has confidence and timing to spare, and its jokes are pretty good, too, so I feel like this show is going to be one of the big winners of the season.  Rating:               Odds and Ends  • We got a cute check-in with Anri and Ogura, too, and the girls actually play pretty well off of each other, though even Shamiko assures us that it will be the “first and last time” that the show indulges the two with their own show-within-a-show.   • One of my favorite running gags of this series is how Shamiko's mother's go-to solution for all of life's problems is just to get embarrassingly drunk and mess around with her cardboard-box husband.

If you actually sit down and consider Mikan's backstory for a bit, it's honestly a bit heartbreaking: Her father made a desperate wish to save their family's factory (the same one where Daddy-Box's current vessel was made), and it ended up ruining his daughter's life. Poor little Mikan was so scared of her misfortune curse, and what it could possibly do to the ones that she loved; it wasn't until an equally little (and adorable) Momo came to save her that Mikan was able to see a way out of her predicament.  It's the exact kind of melodramatic fantasy that you'd expect to play out in any typical magical girl anime, but since this is The Demon Girl Next Door, that means we also get to balance out the melancholy with Shamiko finding a magic fork in the dirt that she is just soexcited to have. Well, okay, it's not technically a magic fork (though it still serves as a great payoff to the very first episode of season one, when Shamiko literally used a fork as her primary weapon against her “arch rival” Momo). Rather, it's an ancient and powerful artifact that once belonged to Joshua, aka Daddy-Box, and Shamiko's mother very helpfully clarifies that the Whatchamacallit Wand can be any vaguely cylindrical device that its wielder can imagine: a fork, a infinite-ammo rocket launcher, a larger fork, a laundry rack. you name it!  So, not only do we have even more tidbits of demon and magical girl lore to chew on, but Shamiko now has an ungodly powerful weapon that she can use to fulfill her ultimate destiny: That of a prop comedian. So what if her first ever bit goes down like the Hindenberg in front of all of her friends? Like the narrator reminds us, comedy is more about confidence and timing than it is about the actual quality of the jokes. That might not be true all of the time, but The Demon Girl Next Door has confidence and timing to spare, and its jokes are pretty good, too, so I feel like this show is going to be one of the big winners of the season.  Rating:               Odds and Ends  • We got a cute check-in with Anri and Ogura, too, and the girls actually play pretty well off of each other, though even Shamiko assures us that it will be the “first and last time” that the show indulges the two with their own show-within-a-show.   • One of my favorite running gags of this series is how Shamiko's mother's go-to solution for all of life's problems is just to get embarrassingly drunk and mess around with her cardboard-box husband. That's hashtag relatable, I'll tell you what.   • Another great running gag is how amazingly intelligent and capable Ryo is, considering who she is related to. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the show depicting her as the one who could really take over the world with dark magic…if she ever wanted to.   • I mentioned the show's Big Gay Energy a bit in my preview guide coverage, but Shamiko's desire to make Momo laugh again has only sealed the deal on the ship. Plus, reading the manga has made the joke about Shamiko trying to recruit Momo as her “vassal” hit a lot harder. Join the forces of Darkness, Momo! They have much better food, at the very least!

Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4             I knew absolutely nothing about The Demon Girl Next Door when I happened upon its 2nd season premiere for this Spring's Preview Guide, but boy did it make  one heck of an impression. Despite my complete lack of context and background knowledge, I was able to immediately jive with the show's adorable aesthetic and equally loveable cast. It helped a ton that the show's character writing and joke-craft was shockingly precise and efficient, meaning that I was able to learn pretty much everything I needed to enjoy the series simply by following along and laughing along with the cast.  Between then and now, though, I knew I'd probably have to catch up on the first series if I was going to do a proper job of reviewing its sequel, and while I didn't have time to watch every episode of the anime, I was able to binge the first two volumes of the manga, which just so happens to coincide with everything that (I assume) got covered in Season 1. I'm really glad I did, too, because Episode 2 of The Demon Girl Next Door's second season features a lot of backstory and payoff that I definitely wouldn't have appreciated if I hadn't taken the time to get to know Shamiko, Momo, Mikan, and the rest of the gang more properly.  When Mikan arrived on the scene and DGND started delving more into the complicated history that Momo's stepsister Sakura shares with Shamiko's family, I knew that we were bound to get a deeper dive into the magical girls' background, and that's where a lot of the focus lies in “Urban Exploration! The Troubled Mikan and the Excited Demon”. Sure, it's mostly a character-focused exploration, giving us a glimpse at how Mikan met Momo and got roped into the world of magical girls herself, but it's a compelling one. One of the things I've come to love about DGND is how it can so casually lay out the more complex and serious elements of its lore without ever losing sight of its breezy tone.

Interest Squidward Recommendation Helps Erotic Manga Dick Fight Island Trend on Twitter   posted on 2022-04-20 00:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         Recommendation from ""Squidward"" helps push manga back to the top of Amazon Bestseller list    Reibun Ike's erotic manga Dick Fight Island was trending on Twitter yesterday after a Barnes and Nobel recommendation display was shared across the social media platform. The recommendation card, shared by two different users, declared that the series about male tribal representatives grappling nude was approved by Spongebob Squarepant's own Squidward. Over 100,000 tweets about the topic helped launch the manga onto Twitter's Trending list.    The card reads:  The absolute peak of storytelling. It is a spellbinding tale of warriors battling for supremacy with their girthy sabers. The art is beautiful enough to leave a man screaming in ecstacy [sic]. 11/10 would ride the Dick Fight again! Squidward approved!  Ike thanked fans for their support of the series on Tuesday. The resurgence in discussion helped push the manga's first volume back to the top of Amazon's Yaoi Manga list.    Viz Media's SuBLime imprint released the second volume of Ike's Dick Fight Island manga on March 8. The 1st ranked as the #1 Romance Manga and #1 Yaoi & LGBTQ+ Manga on Amazon's Best Seller list last year.        discuss this in the forum (20 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Interest Squidward Recommendation Helps Erotic Manga Dick Fight Island Trend on Twitter   posted on 2022-04-20 00:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         Recommendation from ""Squidward"" helps push manga back to the top of Amazon Bestseller list    Reibun Ike's erotic manga Dick Fight Island was trending on Twitter yesterday after a Barnes and Nobel recommendation display was shared across the social media platform. The recommendation card, shared by two different users, declared that the series about male tribal representatives grappling nude was approved by Spongebob Squarepant's own Squidward. Over 100,000 tweets about the topic helped launch the manga onto Twitter's Trending list.    The card reads:  The absolute peak of storytelling. It is a spellbinding tale of warriors battling for supremacy with their girthy sabers. The art is beautiful enough to leave a man screaming in ecstacy [sic]. 11/10 would ride the Dick Fight again! Squidward approved!  Ike thanked fans for their support of the series on Tuesday. The resurgence in discussion helped push the manga's first volume back to the top of Amazon's Yaoi Manga list.    Viz Media's SuBLime imprint released the second volume of Ike's Dick Fight Island manga on March 8. The 1st ranked as the #1 Romance Manga and #1 Yaoi & LGBTQ+ Manga on Amazon's Best Seller list last year.        discuss this in the forum (20 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

GKIDS describes the story:   It's 1889 and people from around the globe are flocking to Paris to see scientific achievements at the Exposition Universelle despite rumors of dangers lurking in the oceans. While attending the fair, teenaged inventor Jean meets Nadia, a mysterious girl who possesses a highly sought-after crystal called Blue Water. Pursued by nefarious forces, the pair journey by sea and by sky to escape their would-be captors and to discover the secret of the crystal.   The staff featured director Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion, His and Her Circumstances), character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honnêamise, Evangelion, Summer Wars), sound director Katsunori Shimizu (Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee, Fushigi Yugi), and musical composer Shiro Sagisu (Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Evangelion).    Sentai Filmworks previously released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The anime was previously released on video tape by Streamline Pictures, and on video tape and DVD by ADV Films.

News GKIDS to Release Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water TV Anime With 4K Restoration   posted on 2022-04-20 23:46 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Company to release series directed by Evangelion's Hideaki Anno on home video    GKIDS announced on Wednesday that it has acquired the North American rights for Gainax's science-fiction adventure anime Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water, and it will release the series on home video, based on a new 4K restoration.    GKIDS describes the story:   It's 1889 and people from around the globe are flocking to Paris to see scientific achievements at the Exposition Universelle despite rumors of dangers lurking in the oceans. While attending the fair, teenaged inventor Jean meets Nadia, a mysterious girl who possesses a highly sought-after crystal called Blue Water. Pursued by nefarious forces, the pair journey by sea and by sky to escape their would-be captors and to discover the secret of the crystal.   The staff featured director Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion, His and Her Circumstances), character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honnêamise, Evangelion, Summer Wars), sound director Katsunori Shimizu (Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee, Fushigi Yugi), and musical composer Shiro Sagisu (Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Evangelion).    Sentai Filmworks previously released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The anime was previously released on video tape by Streamline Pictures, and on video tape and DVD by ADV Films.

Methinks nobody that worked there wrote that. It's more likely that someone came in, stole one of the little recommendation stands off some other book, got another card to put in the stand and made this as a joke.  Or maybe someone that quit that day or got fired did it on their way out.  Either way, I don't think anyone's losing a job because I bet whoever the culprit is didn't have a job there to lose.

Methinks nobody that worked there wrote that. It's more likely that someone came in, stole one of the little recommendation stands off some other book, got another card to put in the stand and made this as a joke.  Or maybe someone that quit that day or got fired did it on their way out.  Either way, I don't think anyone's losing a job because I bet whoever the culprit is didn't have a job there to lose.

It was going by ""Oniichan is Done For"" which could have more inadvertently misogynistic implications or negative PR because of that title.  Probably good they changed it.   Anyway, I'm glad it's getting an adaptation (wow the GBs are really rolling out these days).

What I mean is ""Oniichan is Done For"" is fine as a literal translation of the Japanese title (retaining the Japanese word for ""brother"").  However what I said about mysogyny was that the ""Done For"" part could be taken in the negative sense that simply becoming female is a burden, hinderance or an end to one's life as they know it.  With new title ""ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!"" that implication is not there anymore (and maybe it's just as accurate to the Japanese title).

So ultimately it was just a matter of time. Looking forward to this, but obviously with a bit of skepticism, because there is a good chance not everyone will consider it appropriate, even though there isn't actually anything bad to it. Either way it's gonna be fun to see how much they will adapt and if they'll skip anything.

It's like ""gender benders"" always piss someone off.  A) You got the wish-fulfillment fans who don't want things watered down in the anime version (really with ONIMAI, there's nothing to water down).  B) You got the LGBTQ Police who are all about representation this, representation that (as if ONIMAI is looking for approval from the LGBTQ community).  C) You got the specific fans of this title who are kind of in the middle of Group A and B who like this surge in gender bender popularity, but the anime production team screws it up because they try too hard to please both Group A and B.

Studio Bind though - should at least look good.

What I mean is ""Oniichan is Done For"" is fine as a literal translation of the Japanese title (retaining the Japanese word for ""brother"").  However what I said about mysogyny was that the ""Done For"" part could be taken in the negative sense that simply becoming female is a burden, hinderance or an end to one's life as they know it.  With new title ""ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!"" that implication is not there anymore (and maybe it's just as accurate to the Japanese title).

So ultimately it was just a matter of time. Looking forward to this, but obviously with a bit of skepticism, because there is a good chance not everyone will consider it appropriate, even though there isn't actually anything bad to it. Either way it's gonna be fun to see how much they will adapt and if they'll skip anything.

It's like ""gender benders"" always piss someone off.  A) You got the wish-fulfillment fans who don't want things watered down in the anime version (really with ONIMAI, there's nothing to water down).  B) You got the LGBTQ Police who are all about representation this, representation that (as if ONIMAI is looking for approval from the LGBTQ community).  C) You got the specific fans of this title who are kind of in the middle of Group A and B who like this surge in gender bender popularity, but the anime production team screws it up because they try too hard to please both Group A and B.

Studio Bind though - should at least look good.

What I mean is ""Oniichan is Done For"" is fine as a literal translation of the Japanese title (retaining the Japanese word for ""brother"").

So ultimately it was just a matter of time. Looking forward to this, but obviously with a bit of skepticism, because there is a good chance not everyone will consider it appropriate, even though there isn't actually anything bad to it. Either way it's gonna be fun to see how much they will adapt and if they'll skip anything.

It's like ""gender benders"" always piss someone off.  A) You got the wish-fulfillment fans who don't want things watered down in the anime version (really with ONIMAI, there's nothing to water down).  B) You got the LGBTQ Police who are all about representation this, representation that (as if ONIMAI is looking for approval from the LGBTQ community).  C) You got the specific fans of this title who are kind of in the middle of Group A and B who like this surge in gender bender popularity, but the anime production team screws it up because they try too hard to please both Group A and B.

It's like ""gender benders"" always piss someone off.  A) You got the wish-fulfillment fans who don't want things watered down in the anime version (really with ONIMAI, there's nothing to water down).  B) You got the LGBTQ Police who are all about representation this, representation that (as if ONIMAI is looking for approval from the LGBTQ community).  C) You got the specific fans of this title who are kind of in the middle of Group A and B who like this surge in gender bender popularity, but the anime production team screws it up because they try too hard to please both Group A and B.

Looking forward to this, but obviously with a bit of skepticism, because there is a good chance not everyone will consider it appropriate, even though there isn't actually anything bad to it.

With new title ""ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!"" that implication is not there anymore (and maybe it's just as accurate to the Japanese title).           Oh, OK - so it's the previous official English translation. I thought you were talking about the Japanese title.

So ultimately it was just a matter of time. Looking forward to this, but obviously with a bit of skepticism, because there is a good chance not everyone will consider it appropriate, even though there isn't actually anything bad to it. Either way it's gonna be fun to see how much they will adapt and if they'll skip anything.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!
