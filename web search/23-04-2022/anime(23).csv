REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book.

I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon.

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude.

Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.

23-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/love-all-play/.183508,Love All Play - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"   The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.

News Isekai Quartet: Another World Anime Film's Trailer Previews Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-22 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Konomi Suzuki featuring Kashitarō Itō performs theme song for June 10 film    The official website for the Gekijо̄ban Isekai Quartet ~Another World~ (Isekai Quartet the Movie: Another World) crossover anime film began streaming a trailer on Friday. The video previews the film's theme song ""Melodic Road Movie"" performed by Konomi Suzuki featuring Kashitarō Itō:      The film will premiere on June 10. In the film, the characters can transport themselves to an alternate world due to a wormhole that suddenly opened in the classroom. They all arrive at a world ruled by an out-of-control golem. They also encounter a golem girl whose personality is similar to Megumin, a cane-wielding man who seems to know Subaru, and a woman dressed in the same uniform as Tanya's. Our intrepid group strives to return to their world.    The film's original characters and their cast members are, from left to right below:     Minami Tanaka as Pantagruel, a mysterious eye-patched girl  Nana Mizuki as Vera Mitrohina, a mysterious female soldier   Toshiyuki Morikawa as Alec, a mysterious man          The film features the returning cast and staff from the anime's first two seasons. Minoru Ashina (Kaiju Girls, Pure Pure Purea Desu Overlord shorts) is writing the script and directing the anime. Minoru Takehara serves as both character designer and chief animation director. Studio Puyukai (Kaiju Girls, Lord Marksman and Vanadis, Pure Pure Purea Desu Overlord shorts) is animating the work.      The 12th and final episode of the Isekai Quartet 2 anime had revealed in April 2020 that the series was getting a sequel.    The anime is a crossover series between the Re:Zero, Overlord, KONOSUBA, and The Saga of Tanya the Evil franchises. Isekai Quartet 2 also features characters from The Rising of The Shield Hero franchise. The first season premiered in Japan in April 2019. Crunchyroll and Funimation both streamed the first season as it aired.   Update: Kashitarō Itō's name corrected. Thanks, 48 Rices.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center.

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in.

Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime.

Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.

23-04-2022,anime,6,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/healer-girl/.183520,Healer Girl - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

But the ones that do get blacklisted and booted from the industry sadly.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.

It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe.

In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness.

Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"
23-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/weekly-ranking/2022/winter/.182540,The Best and Worst of Winter 2022 - Anime News Network:SEA,"      Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.

While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          25 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing.

So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.    According to the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology, periodontal diseases are the leading cause of teeth loss (37%) in Japan; they affect more than 50% of people over the age of 45, and about 20% of people between the ages of 15 and 24. They hope that the anime can raise awareness among youths about the prevalence of periodontal diseases, the need for prevention and treatment, and the importance of dental check-ups.

Interest Voice Actor Natsuki Hanae Plays All Three Roles In Anime Short About Gum Diseases   posted on 2022-04-20 05:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           On April 18 (also known as ""Good Teeth Day"" in Japan), Cat Bites Mouse, a six-episode educational anime short about periodontal diseases, was released on YouTube. The shorts feature performances by Demon Slayer star Natsuki Hanae as all three characters and character designs by Kanahei. The short was produced in a collaboration between the Japanese Society of Periodontology and the Japanese Academy of Clinical Periodontology.      The first episode of Cat Bites Mouse depicts a scene in which the cat Nyan-chan catches a mouse. When Nyan-chan opens her mouth wide, ready to eat the mouse, the mouse points out that Nyan-chan has periodontal disease. In order to survive, the mouse lays out the horrors of periodontal disease to Nyan-chan, thus starting a story of friendship between Nyan-chan and the mouse.    Notably, all three roles in the short – the cat Nyan-chan, the mouse, and the dentist Kabayama Kabahiko – are played by Hanae. ""Since the cat is a girl, I tried my best to do a cute voice. I think it is a good anime where you can learn about teeth in a fun, contrived way,"" Hanae commented.
