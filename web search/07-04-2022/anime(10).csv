Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize.

With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

News Saudi Arabia's MiSK Foundation Now Owns 96.18% Stake in SNK   posted on 2022-04-06 14:34 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Company previously owned 33.3% of SNK after 2020 investment through subsidiary    Game developer SNK announced on February 15 that Electronic Gaming Development Company, the company wholly owned by Saudi Arabian organization MiSK Foundation (Mohammed bin Salman Foundation), now owns a 96.18% stake in SNK after purchasing more shares.    Electronic Gaming Development Company initially invested US$216.5 million in SNK in November 2020. It acquired a 33.3% stake in the company at the time, with a plan to purchase an additional 17.7% stake in the future to raise its ownership to 51%.    Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is the organization's founder and chairman. The organization and the Saudi Arabian animation studio Manga Productions (also owned by MiSK Foundation) have hosted an internship program with SNK in the past. Manga Productions has also collaborated with Toei Animation on a number of anime projects, including ""The Woodcutter's Treasure"" short, Future's Folktales, and The Journey.    Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman established MiSK in 2011. In February 2021, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist who relocated to the United States and wrote for The Washington Post newspaper before being killed in 2018. The Saudi Arabian government ""completely reject[ed]"" the U.S. assessment.    SNK is known for its franchises such as King of Fighters, Metal Slug, Fatal Fury (Garō Densetsu), and Samurai Shodown (Samurai Spirits), and the NeoGeo console. SNK most recently released its The King of Fighters XV game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Windows 10, Steam, and the Epic Games Store on February 17.

News Saudi Arabia's MiSK Foundation Now Owns 96.18% Stake in SNK   posted on 2022-04-06 14:34 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Company previously owned 33.3% of SNK after 2020 investment through subsidiary    Game developer SNK announced on February 15 that Electronic Gaming Development Company, the company wholly owned by Saudi Arabian organization MiSK Foundation (Mohammed bin Salman Foundation), now owns a 96.18% stake in SNK after purchasing more shares.    Electronic Gaming Development Company initially invested US$216.5 million in SNK in November 2020. It acquired a 33.3% stake in the company at the time, with a plan to purchase an additional 17.7% stake in the future to raise its ownership to 51%.    Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is the organization's founder and chairman. The organization and the Saudi Arabian animation studio Manga Productions (also owned by MiSK Foundation) have hosted an internship program with SNK in the past. Manga Productions has also collaborated with Toei Animation on a number of anime projects, including ""The Woodcutter's Treasure"" short, Future's Folktales, and The Journey.    Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman established MiSK in 2011. In February 2021, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist who relocated to the United States and wrote for The Washington Post newspaper before being killed in 2018. The Saudi Arabian government ""completely reject[ed]"" the U.S. assessment.    SNK is known for its franchises such as King of Fighters, Metal Slug, Fatal Fury (Garō Densetsu), and Samurai Shodown (Samurai Spirits), and the NeoGeo console. SNK most recently released its The King of Fighters XV game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Windows 10, Steam, and the Epic Games Store on February 17.

News Saudi Arabia's MiSK Foundation Now Owns 96.18% Stake in SNK   posted on 2022-04-06 14:34 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Company previously owned 33.3% of SNK after 2020 investment through subsidiary    Game developer SNK announced on February 15 that Electronic Gaming Development Company, the company wholly owned by Saudi Arabian organization MiSK Foundation (Mohammed bin Salman Foundation), now owns a 96.18% stake in SNK after purchasing more shares.    Electronic Gaming Development Company initially invested US$216.5 million in SNK in November 2020. It acquired a 33.3% stake in the company at the time, with a plan to purchase an additional 17.7% stake in the future to raise its ownership to 51%.    Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is the organization's founder and chairman. The organization and the Saudi Arabian animation studio Manga Productions (also owned by MiSK Foundation) have hosted an internship program with SNK in the past. Manga Productions has also collaborated with Toei Animation on a number of anime projects, including ""The Woodcutter's Treasure"" short, Future's Folktales, and The Journey.    Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman established MiSK in 2011. In February 2021, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist who relocated to the United States and wrote for The Washington Post newspaper before being killed in 2018. The Saudi Arabian government ""completely reject[ed]"" the U.S. assessment.

News Dark Horse to Publish 1st Berserk Manga Volume Since Kentarou Miura's Passing in November   posted on 2022-04-05 02:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24    Dark Horse Comics confirmed with Crunchyroll on Monday that it will release the 41st compiled book volume of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga, which includes the final chapters that Miura had created for the series, in November. The volume (English cover pictured right) will go on sale at comic stores on November 9 and in bookstores on November 22. The trade paperback release will include a two-sided color poster insert.    This was the series' first volume since Miura's passing in May, and the first in three years.    The 41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24.    Previous advertisements in the The New York Times had stated that the manga's 41st volume would launch in the U.S. and France in summer 2022. Dark Horse Comics has since stated that those advertisements were estimated release windows, and the actual date had to be adjusted.    The afterword in the 41st volume from Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga is still undecided. The staff also thanked its readers.    The editorial staff had stated in September that there was ""no information to share about the future"" of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga ""at this time."" The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

News Dark Horse to Publish 1st Berserk Manga Volume Since Kentarou Miura's Passing in November   posted on 2022-04-05 02:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24    Dark Horse Comics confirmed with Crunchyroll on Monday that it will release the 41st compiled book volume of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga, which includes the final chapters that Miura had created for the series, in November. The volume (English cover pictured right) will go on sale at comic stores on November 9 and in bookstores on November 22. The trade paperback release will include a two-sided color poster insert.    This was the series' first volume since Miura's passing in May, and the first in three years.    The 41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24.    Previous advertisements in the The New York Times had stated that the manga's 41st volume would launch in the U.S. and France in summer 2022. Dark Horse Comics has since stated that those advertisements were estimated release windows, and the actual date had to be adjusted.    The afterword in the 41st volume from Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga is still undecided. The staff also thanked its readers.    The editorial staff had stated in September that there was ""no information to share about the future"" of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga ""at this time."" The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

I had a hard time paying attention to the sub of LOGH due to information overload and the dub really helps to ease that   The only issue is there STILL isn't the dub for seasons 1 and 2 on Crunchyroll yet      Back to top                  penguintruth    Joined: 08 Dec 2004 		    Posts: 8214 		    Location: Penguinopolis 		        Posted: Wed Apr 06, 2022 5:02 pm            I've found the DNT dub to be pretty average, overall. Voice actors like Aaron Dismuke and Clifford Chapin carry the rest of the cast. But it's good enough to present to others, so I'm fine with them continuing with the same people. It'll make it more accessible.

Past season several dubs were added on funimation, Crunchyroll and wakanim simultaneously  (well almost, morons at wakanim uploaded all dubs 1 week later on every Tuesday, with non removable cc subs in their apps...)   Only thing that changed is the name.   But honestly Crunchyroll/Funimation, go dub older shows asap please. Laid back camp ?

Voice actors like Aaron Dismuke and Clifford Chapin carry the rest of the cast. But it's good enough to present to others, so I'm fine with them continuing with the same people. It'll make it more accessible.

News Witch Hat Atelier Manga Gets Anime   posted on 2022-04-05 23:36 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Teaser video, commemorative art unveiled    The official website of Kodansha's Morning two magazine announced on Tuesday that Kamome Shirahama's Witch Hat Atelier manga is getting an anime adaptation. A special website opened and unveiled a teaser video:       Shirahama drew an illustration to commemorate the anime's announcement:     The website will reveal more details including the broadcast premiere at a later date.    The manga's story centers on Koko, a girl who lives in a little village, and who has always dreamed of becoming a wizard. But being born without magical aptitude meant that she could never become a wizard, and could never hope to witness magic's spark. She gave up on her dream. But one day, a traveling wizard named Kiefley came to her village, and she happened to see him performing magic.    Shirahama launched the manga in Morning two in July 2016. Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.    The manga has over 2.5 million copies in circulation worldwide.    The series was nominated for the Best Comic award at Angoulême International Comics Festival in January 2019. The manga was also nominated for the 11th Manga Taisho awards in 2018. The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook. The manga ranked on American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens list in 2020. The series won Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in October 2020.

News Witch Hat Atelier Manga Gets Anime   posted on 2022-04-05 23:36 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Teaser video, commemorative art unveiled    The official website of Kodansha's Morning two magazine announced on Tuesday that Kamome Shirahama's Witch Hat Atelier manga is getting an anime adaptation. A special website opened and unveiled a teaser video:       Shirahama drew an illustration to commemorate the anime's announcement:     The website will reveal more details including the broadcast premiere at a later date.    The manga's story centers on Koko, a girl who lives in a little village, and who has always dreamed of becoming a wizard. But being born without magical aptitude meant that she could never become a wizard, and could never hope to witness magic's spark. She gave up on her dream. But one day, a traveling wizard named Kiefley came to her village, and she happened to see him performing magic.    Shirahama launched the manga in Morning two in July 2016. Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.    The manga has over 2.5 million copies in circulation worldwide.    The series was nominated for the Best Comic award at Angoulême International Comics Festival in January 2019. The manga was also nominated for the 11th Manga Taisho awards in 2018. The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook. The manga ranked on American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens list in 2020. The series won Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in October 2020.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.3           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.3           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.3           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself! (Via Kodansha Comics)    Shangri-La Frontier Ryōsuke Fuji, Katarina Magazine: Weekly Shōnen Magazine (Kodansha) Summary: Second year high school student Rakurou Hizutome is interested in one thing only: finding ""shitty games"" and beating the crap out of them. His gaming skills are second to none, and no game is too bad for him to enjoy. So when he's introduced to the new VR game Shangri-La Frontier, he does what he does best—min-maxes and skips the prologue to jump straight into the action.

So when he wakes up in a new world straight out of a fantasy RPG, he's disappointed but not exactly surprised to find that he's not a knight or a wizard but a he's become a blind, boneless slime monster. But there are chances for even a slime to become a hero… (Via Yen Press)   Best Shōjo Manga  In the Clear Moonlit Dusk Mika Yamamori Magazine: Dessert (Kodansha) Summary: Yoi Takiguchi has long legs, a deep voice, and a handsome face...in other words, Yoi is such a good-looking guy that most people don't notice or care that she is, in fact, a girl. Indeed, she's had the nickname ""Prince"" as long as she can remember. That is, until she met Ichimura-senpai...the only person who's really seemed to see her for herself. To her surprise, she's not sure how to handle this new relationship, especially when her newfound friend is a prince himself (and a guy prince, at that). The story of the two high school princes starts here! (Via Kodansha Comics)    Nina the Starry Bride Rikachi Magazine: Be Love (Kodansha) Summary: Nina had a rough start to life, stealing to survive—and eventually being sold into slavery by her own brother.

But despite her changing fortune, Nina won't give up her old life without a fight...and Azure might just be the one to finally match her wits. But how much can she trust Azure? And can she stop the feelings budding in her heart, knowing she must eventually marry another...? (Via Kodansha Comics)    A Sign of Affection Suu Morishita Magazine: Dessert (Kodansha) Summary: Yuki is a typical college student, whose world revolves around her friends, social media, and the latest sales. But when a chance encounter on a train leads to her meeting friend-of-a-friend and fellow student Itsuomi-san, her world starts to widen.

(Via Kodansha Comics)    My Happy Marriage Rito Kohsaka Magazine: Gangan Online (Square Enix) Summary: Born to a noble family, Miyo is raised by her abusive stepmother and married off to Kiyoka, a soldier so heartless his prior fiancées fled within three days into their engagement. With no home to return to, Miyo slowly starts to open her heart to her cold and pale husband-to-be, despite their rocky introduction... This might just be her chance at finding true love and happiness. (Via Yen Press' description of the original novels)   Best General Manga  Oshi no Ko Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari Magazine: Weekly Young Jump (Shueisha) Summary: The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies.

News 46th Annual Kodansha Manga Awards' Nominees Announced   posted on 2022-04-07 15:46 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          A Couple of Cuckoos, Frieren, Nina the Starry Bride, Skip and Loafer, Police in a Pod among nominees    Japanese publisher Kodansha announced the 14 nominees in three categories for its 46th annual Manga Awards on Thursday. Kodansha will announce the winner for each category on May 11.   Best Shōnen Manga  A Couple of Cuckoos Miki Yoshikawa Magazine: Weekly Shōnen Magazine (Kodansha) Summary: 16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself! (Via Kodansha Comics)    Shangri-La Frontier Ryōsuke Fuji, Katarina Magazine: Weekly Shōnen Magazine (Kodansha) Summary: Second year high school student Rakurou Hizutome is interested in one thing only: finding ""shitty games"" and beating the crap out of them. His gaming skills are second to none, and no game is too bad for him to enjoy. So when he's introduced to the new VR game Shangri-La Frontier, he does what he does best—min-maxes and skips the prologue to jump straight into the action. But can even an expert gamer like Rakurou discover all the secrets that Shangri-La Frontier hides...? (Via Kodansha Comics)    Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Kanehito Yamada, Tsukasa Abe Magazine: Weekly Shonen Sunday (Shogakukan) Summary: The adventure is over but life goes on for an elf mage just beginning to learn what living is all about. Elf mage Frieren and her courageous fellow adventurers have defeated the Demon King and brought peace to the land. But Frieren will long outlive the rest of her former party. How will she come to understand what life means to the people around her? Decades after their victory, the funeral of one her friends confronts Frieren with her own near immortality. Frieren sets out to fulfill the last wishes of her comrades and finds herself beginning a new adventure… (Via Viz Media)    That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Taiki Kawakami Magazine: Shonen Sirius (Kodansha) Summary: Mikami's middle age hasn't gone as he planned: He never found a girlfriend, he got stuck in a dead-end job, and he was abruptly stabbed to death in the street at 37. So when he wakes up in a new world straight out of a fantasy RPG, he's disappointed but not exactly surprised to find that he's not a knight or a wizard but a he's become a blind, boneless slime monster. But there are chances for even a slime to become a hero… (Via Yen Press)   Best Shōjo Manga  In the Clear Moonlit Dusk Mika Yamamori Magazine: Dessert (Kodansha) Summary: Yoi Takiguchi has long legs, a deep voice, and a handsome face...in other words, Yoi is such a good-looking guy that most people don't notice or care that she is, in fact, a girl. Indeed, she's had the nickname ""Prince"" as long as she can remember. That is, until she met Ichimura-senpai...the only person who's really seemed to see her for herself. To her surprise, she's not sure how to handle this new relationship, especially when her newfound friend is a prince himself (and a guy prince, at that). The story of the two high school princes starts here! (Via Kodansha Comics)    Nina the Starry Bride Rikachi Magazine: Be Love (Kodansha) Summary: Nina had a rough start to life, stealing to survive—and eventually being sold into slavery by her own brother. But to her surprise, her captor, Prince Azure, ordained that she would live the life of a princess...specifically, that of the recently deceased princess-priestess, Alisha. But despite her changing fortune, Nina won't give up her old life without a fight...and Azure might just be the one to finally match her wits. But how much can she trust Azure? And can she stop the feelings budding in her heart, knowing she must eventually marry another...? (Via Kodansha Comics)    A Sign of Affection Suu Morishita Magazine: Dessert (Kodansha) Summary: Yuki is a typical college student, whose world revolves around her friends, social media, and the latest sales. But when a chance encounter on a train leads to her meeting friend-of-a-friend and fellow student Itsuomi-san, her world starts to widen. But even though Itsuomi-kun can speak three languages, sign language isn't one of them. Can the two learn to communicate the budding feelings between them? (Via Kodansha Comics)    My Happy Marriage Rito Kohsaka Magazine: Gangan Online (Square Enix) Summary: Born to a noble family, Miyo is raised by her abusive stepmother and married off to Kiyoka, a soldier so heartless his prior fiancées fled within three days into their engagement. With no home to return to, Miyo slowly starts to open her heart to her cold and pale husband-to-be, despite their rocky introduction... This might just be her chance at finding true love and happiness. (Via Yen Press' description of the original novels)   Best General Manga  Oshi no Ko Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari Magazine: Weekly Young Jump (Shueisha) Summary: The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact.    Skip and Loafer Misaki Takamatsu Magazine: Afternoon (Kodansha) Summary: Excellent student Iwakura Mitsumi has always dreamt about leaving her small town, going to a prestigious university, and making positive change in the world. But she's so focused on reaching her goals that she's not prepared for the very different (and overwhelming) city life that awaits her in a Tokyo high school. Luckily, she makes fast friends with Shima Sousuke, a handsome classmate who's as laid-back as she is over-prepared. Can this naive country girl make it big in Tokyo with Sousuke by her side? (Via Seven Seas Entertainment)    Chi: Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite Uoto Magazine: Big Comic Spirits (Shogakukan) Summary: Sparks of the discoveries of the Renaissance are only beginning to burn in 15th century Europe, even as those who make discoveries are burned for their heresy. In Poland, a child prodigy named Rafal is expected to be another great mind in theology, but an encounter with a certain man leads him down the path to a heretical truth.    Police in a Pod Miko Yasu Magazine: Morning (Kodansha) Summary: Female police officer Kawai had enough of a career she wasn't even that into and was about to hand in her registration, when the unthinkable happened—she met the new, female director of her station! And after spending a little time with this gorgeous role model, Kawai realizes that maybe she isn't quite done being an officer after all. (Via Kodansha Comics)    Yankee-kun to Hakujō Girl (The Delinquent and the Girl With the White Cane) Uoyama Magazine: pixiv, Nico Nico Seiga, Manga Hack (Kadokawa) Summary: The manga centers on the relationship between a delinquent named Morio Kurokawa, who rules the city streets, and a girl named Yukiko Akaze, who goes to a school for the blind.    Yakuza Fiancé: Raise wa Tanin ga Ii Asuka Konishi Magazine: Afternoon (Kodansha) Summary: Yoshino grew up as the yakuza princess of the Osaka Somei crime family. Everyone left her alone due to her sharp gaze and mobster ties. But when her grandfather signs a truce with the Tokyo-based Miyama crime family, she's offered for betrothal to the Miyama leader's grandson, Kirishima. At first, Kirishima seems amiable and polite--but when he shows his dark side, he proves to be more disturbing than any gangster Yoshino has ever met. This engagement is sure to be a wild ride for a tough yakuza princess and her twisted yakuza prince! (Via Seven Seas Entertainment)    In past years, Kodansha gave out a ""Best Children's Manga"" award as well, but starting in 2015 Kodansha has integrated the nominees for that category into the Best Shōnen Manga and Best Shōjo Manga categories instead.    Last year, Muneyuki Kaneshiro and Yūsuke Nomura's Blue Lock won the Best Shonen Manga award. Megumi Morino's A Condition Called Love won the Best Shōjo Manga award. Kiwa Irie's Yuria Sensei no Akai Ito won the Best General Manga award.

Bandai Namco Partners With the Angels as It Officially Calls Southern California Home   Apr  7th 2022         Beloved Bandai Namco Brands Such as Pac-Man Set to Delight Fans at Angel Stadium; Company Also Plans Event in Irvine to Meet the Orange County Community   IRVINE, Calif. (April 6, 2022) – Bandai Namco Group today announced that it has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Angels, bringing one of the most respected entertainment companies in the world together with an iconic MLB club who has been a mainstay for baseball fans in Southern California for more than 60 years. The relationship between the Angels and Bandai Namco is a natural one, as the company with beloved brands in video games, toys, and collectibles such as PAC-MAN®, GUNDAM®, TAMAGOTCHI®, GALAGA®, and TEKKEN®, as well as the recent blockbuster title ELDEN RING™, has recently established its US headquarters in Irvine, California.   Just in time for the exciting start of the 2022 MLB season, fans who attend Angels home games will see Bandai Namco corporate and product branding, including the company's all-new logo, on fixed and rotating signage behind home plate, first and third-baseline signage, and 360-degree LED stadium signage. Bandai Namco Group will also be featured in Angels media including Angel Magazine, social media support, and live game broadcasts on AM830 KLAA, the official radio station of the Angels.  “We are thrilled to welcome Bandai Namco to the Angels Partnership Family,” said Angels Chairman, Dennis Kuhl. “With Bandai Namco moving their US headquarters to Orange County, and our shared objective of entertaining millions while supporting our local community, this is a natural fit between our brands that I know our fans will enjoy.”  “We are proud to partner with the Los Angeles Angels and support California's first MLB club as we bring our own teams together under one roof at Bandai Namco's new US headquarters in Orange County,” said Nobuhiko Momoi, President & CEO, Bandai Namco Holdings USA Inc. “It's thrilling to think that the Bandai Namco brand and signature icons such as Pac-Man, which has been delighting our fans for more than 40 years, will now help bring even more excitement to baseball fans as they sit in beautiful Angel Stadium. We invite members of the Orange County community to learn more about Bandai Namco, a company who has created and published some of the world's most recognized and adored entertainment products.”  In addition to supporting the local MLB club, Bandai Namco wants to introduce its own teams and meet the community in Irvine and Orange County. The company is organizing “Welcome to the PAC!”, an event billed as an introduction to the local community taking place May 1st at the Irvine Spectrum Center. “Welcome to the PAC!” is open to the public, inviting everyone to come participate in a day of fun family-friendly activities that include a main stage with entertainment and musical performances, tents featuring video game demos, goodies, and giveaways.

Bandai Namco Partners With the Angels as It Officially Calls Southern California Home   Apr  7th 2022         Beloved Bandai Namco Brands Such as Pac-Man Set to Delight Fans at Angel Stadium; Company Also Plans Event in Irvine to Meet the Orange County Community   IRVINE, Calif. (April 6, 2022) – Bandai Namco Group today announced that it has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Angels, bringing one of the most respected entertainment companies in the world together with an iconic MLB club who has been a mainstay for baseball fans in Southern California for more than 60 years. The relationship between the Angels and Bandai Namco is a natural one, as the company with beloved brands in video games, toys, and collectibles such as PAC-MAN®, GUNDAM®, TAMAGOTCHI®, GALAGA®, and TEKKEN®, as well as the recent blockbuster title ELDEN RING™, has recently established its US headquarters in Irvine, California.   Just in time for the exciting start of the 2022 MLB season, fans who attend Angels home games will see Bandai Namco corporate and product branding, including the company's all-new logo, on fixed and rotating signage behind home plate, first and third-baseline signage, and 360-degree LED stadium signage. Bandai Namco Group will also be featured in Angels media including Angel Magazine, social media support, and live game broadcasts on AM830 KLAA, the official radio station of the Angels.  “We are thrilled to welcome Bandai Namco to the Angels Partnership Family,” said Angels Chairman, Dennis Kuhl. “With Bandai Namco moving their US headquarters to Orange County, and our shared objective of entertaining millions while supporting our local community, this is a natural fit between our brands that I know our fans will enjoy.”  “We are proud to partner with the Los Angeles Angels and support California's first MLB club as we bring our own teams together under one roof at Bandai Namco's new US headquarters in Orange County,” said Nobuhiko Momoi, President & CEO, Bandai Namco Holdings USA Inc. “It's thrilling to think that the Bandai Namco brand and signature icons such as Pac-Man, which has been delighting our fans for more than 40 years, will now help bring even more excitement to baseball fans as they sit in beautiful Angel Stadium. We invite members of the Orange County community to learn more about Bandai Namco, a company who has created and published some of the world's most recognized and adored entertainment products.”  In addition to supporting the local MLB club, Bandai Namco wants to introduce its own teams and meet the community in Irvine and Orange County. The company is organizing “Welcome to the PAC!”, an event billed as an introduction to the local community taking place May 1st at the Irvine Spectrum Center. “Welcome to the PAC!” is open to the public, inviting everyone to come participate in a day of fun family-friendly activities that include a main stage with entertainment and musical performances, tents featuring video game demos, goodies, and giveaways.

Bandai Namco Partners With the Angels as It Officially Calls Southern California Home   Apr  7th 2022         Beloved Bandai Namco Brands Such as Pac-Man Set to Delight Fans at Angel Stadium; Company Also Plans Event in Irvine to Meet the Orange County Community   IRVINE, Calif. (April 6, 2022) – Bandai Namco Group today announced that it has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Angels, bringing one of the most respected entertainment companies in the world together with an iconic MLB club who has been a mainstay for baseball fans in Southern California for more than 60 years. The relationship between the Angels and Bandai Namco is a natural one, as the company with beloved brands in video games, toys, and collectibles such as PAC-MAN®, GUNDAM®, TAMAGOTCHI®, GALAGA®, and TEKKEN®, as well as the recent blockbuster title ELDEN RING™, has recently established its US headquarters in Irvine, California.   Just in time for the exciting start of the 2022 MLB season, fans who attend Angels home games will see Bandai Namco corporate and product branding, including the company's all-new logo, on fixed and rotating signage behind home plate, first and third-baseline signage, and 360-degree LED stadium signage. Bandai Namco Group will also be featured in Angels media including Angel Magazine, social media support, and live game broadcasts on AM830 KLAA, the official radio station of the Angels.  “We are thrilled to welcome Bandai Namco to the Angels Partnership Family,” said Angels Chairman, Dennis Kuhl. “With Bandai Namco moving their US headquarters to Orange County, and our shared objective of entertaining millions while supporting our local community, this is a natural fit between our brands that I know our fans will enjoy.”  “We are proud to partner with the Los Angeles Angels and support California's first MLB club as we bring our own teams together under one roof at Bandai Namco's new US headquarters in Orange County,” said Nobuhiko Momoi, President & CEO, Bandai Namco Holdings USA Inc. “It's thrilling to think that the Bandai Namco brand and signature icons such as Pac-Man, which has been delighting our fans for more than 40 years, will now help bring even more excitement to baseball fans as they sit in beautiful Angel Stadium. We invite members of the Orange County community to learn more about Bandai Namco, a company who has created and published some of the world's most recognized and adored entertainment products.”  In addition to supporting the local MLB club, Bandai Namco wants to introduce its own teams and meet the community in Irvine and Orange County. The company is organizing “Welcome to the PAC!”, an event billed as an introduction to the local community taking place May 1st at the Irvine Spectrum Center. “Welcome to the PAC!” is open to the public, inviting everyone to come participate in a day of fun family-friendly activities that include a main stage with entertainment and musical performances, tents featuring video game demos, goodies, and giveaways.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.

On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,Don't Set,{}

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated.

At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives    ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City.

Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Interest Ikuhara Apologizes for Timing, Phrasing of New Name Announcement   posted on 2022-04-05 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         ""I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, even if it was not my intention. I will be careful from now on.""    Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara took to Twitter on April 2 to offer an apology and further explain the wording of his recent name change. Ikuhara said that he was unaware that the timing of his announcement on March 31 coincided with International Transgender Day of Visibility and that the wording was actually song lyrics from a track on his upcoming music project.    ""We made the announcement on March 31 because it was the same day that the press release was issued. There was no other meaning behind it. However, I later learned that the timing of the tweet lacked consideration, and that it caused misunderstanding that upset and hurt many people. I could not have imagined that this would happen. I am truly sorry,"" Ikuhara wrote. ""I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, even if it was not my intention. I will be careful from now on.""    The earlier Tweets hinting at the announcement were deleted.    Ikuhara adopted the moniker ""Bonsoir Ikuhara"" as part of a music project with previous collaborators Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.    The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars   Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.

Interest Ikuhara Apologizes for Timing, Phrasing of New Name Announcement   posted on 2022-04-05 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         ""I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, even if it was not my intention. I will be careful from now on.""    Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara took to Twitter on April 2 to offer an apology and further explain the wording of his recent name change. Ikuhara said that he was unaware that the timing of his announcement on March 31 coincided with International Transgender Day of Visibility and that the wording was actually song lyrics from a track on his upcoming music project.    ""We made the announcement on March 31 because it was the same day that the press release was issued. There was no other meaning behind it. However, I later learned that the timing of the tweet lacked consideration, and that it caused misunderstanding that upset and hurt many people. I could not have imagined that this would happen. I am truly sorry,"" Ikuhara wrote. ""I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, even if it was not my intention. I will be careful from now on.""    The earlier Tweets hinting at the announcement were deleted.    Ikuhara adopted the moniker ""Bonsoir Ikuhara"" as part of a music project with previous collaborators Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.    The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars   Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""      follow-up of Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   discuss this in the forum (56 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history     Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Interest Ikuhara Apologizes for Timing, Phrasing of New Name Announcement   posted on 2022-04-05 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         ""I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, even if it was not my intention. I will be careful from now on.""    Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara took to Twitter on April 2 to offer an apology and further explain the wording of his recent name change. Ikuhara said that he was unaware that the timing of his announcement on March 31 coincided with International Transgender Day of Visibility and that the wording was actually song lyrics from a track on his upcoming music project.    ""We made the announcement on March 31 because it was the same day that the press release was issued. There was no other meaning behind it. However, I later learned that the timing of the tweet lacked consideration, and that it caused misunderstanding that upset and hurt many people. I could not have imagined that this would happen. I am truly sorry,"" Ikuhara wrote. ""I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, even if it was not my intention. I will be careful from now on.""    The earlier Tweets hinting at the announcement were deleted.    Ikuhara adopted the moniker ""Bonsoir Ikuhara"" as part of a music project with previous collaborators Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.    The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars   Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""      follow-up of Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   discuss this in the forum (56 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history     Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

David Production only has the producing rights for the 6 Parts of the main JoJo continuity, so I don't know where this confidence that Part 7 will be adapted at all is coming from. People suddenly forgot that it took a longer time for DP to anounce the Stone Ocean anime that what it took to anounce the Golden Wind one, yet they keep expecting a new anime season when the previous one hasn't even started, and in Stone Ocean's case, isn't even halfway through adapting the story.   Honestly, people who are already anxious for a Part 7 anime when we just barely got a Part 6 anime (and only the 1st third at that) come off as part skippers to me, so there's that.

These are the ones who have any say in this matter; if Warner wanted to, the series could have changed studio after the first season.   DP can either accept or refuse the offer that the committee proposes to them.   Also, if you're so enlightened, then tell me where did you get the distribution rights thing.

David Production only has the producing rights for the 6 Parts of the main JoJo continuity, so I don't know where this confidence that Part 7 will be adapted at all is coming from. People suddenly forgot that it took a longer time for DP to anounce the Stone Ocean anime that what it took to anounce the Golden Wind one, yet they keep expecting a new anime season when the previous one hasn't even started, and in Stone Ocean's case, isn't even halfway through adapting the story.

DP is the animation producer, not a part of the production committee aka those who put their money on the table and are the license holders - Warner, Shueisha, Medicos & Klockworx.   These are the ones who have any say in this matter; if Warner wanted to, the series could have changed studio after the first season.   DP can either accept or refuse the offer that the committee proposes to them.   Also, if you're so enlightened, then tell me where did you get the distribution rights thing. And please, don't say Sono Chi No Sadame OP.

David Production only has the producing rights for the 6 Parts of the main JoJo continuity, so I don't know where this confidence that Part 7 will be adapted at all is coming from. People suddenly forgot that it took a longer time for DP to anounce the Stone Ocean anime that what it took to anounce the Golden Wind one, yet they keep expecting a new anime season when the previous one hasn't even started, and in Stone Ocean's case, isn't even halfway through adapting the story.   Honestly, people who are already anxious for a Part 7 anime when we just barely got a Part 6 anime (and only the 1st third at that) come off as part skippers to me, so there's that.   On the other hand, way to go of David Production to celebrate 10 years of JoJo by delaying their 5th season/6th Part  almost a full year.

DP is the animation producer, not a part of the production committee aka those who put their money on the table and are the license holders - Warner, Shueisha, Medicos & Klockworx.   These are the ones who have any say in this matter; if Warner wanted to, the series could have changed studio after the first season.   DP can either accept or refuse the offer that the committee proposes to them.   Also, if you're so enlightened, then tell me where did you get the distribution rights thing.
