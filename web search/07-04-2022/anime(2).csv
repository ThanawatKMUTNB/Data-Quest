News Tohru Fujisawa's Soul Reviver Manga Gets Live-Action Japanese-Korean Show   posted on 2022-04-05 12:58 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Fujisawa, Manabu Akishige launched manga about bringing dead back to life    Hero's Inc. announced on Tuesday that Tohru Fujisawa and Manabu Akishige's Soul Reviver manga is inspiring an upcoming joint Japanese-South Korean live-action show. The show will debut in over-the-top streaming services in South Korea.    Japanese production company Robot and South Korean production company B.A. Entertainment are co-producing the show, through a partnership facilitated by the Visual Industry Promotion Organization since October of last year.    In the original manga, the dead can be brought back to life, if their souls can be restored before disappearing into the void. Between death and the void is the world of the dead, and two individuals — the former detective Ryūsuke Jin and the dead high school girl Clara Sekimachi — salvage souls in this realm.    Fujisawa created the scenario and original character designs, while Akishige drew the manga. The manga launched in Hero's Inc.'s Monthly Hero's magazine in 2011, and ended it in November 2014 with four volumes.    Shogakukan promoted the third volume with a 3D CG short in April 2013, and Kaizō Hayashi (Maiku Hama films, creative director for 7 Blades game) directed a nine-minute live-action short based on the manga in December 2013. The series also had a Hollywood live-action film adaptation in the works, with Annmarie Sairrino's previous ANEW Entertainment production company no longer moving forward with the film. Sairrino left ANEW following a corporate reorganization in 2017, and the film's production ceased to proceed. Edward Zwick (director, The Last Samurai, Glory, Courage Under Fire) and Marshall Herskovitz (producer, The Last Samurai, Traffic, I Am Sam) were once attached to the film via Herskovitz's The Bedford Falls Compan.    Fujisawa (GTO) began the Soul Reviver South series as the manga's ""second season"" in Monthly Hero's in December 2014, one month after the original manga ended. The second series ended in February 2016 with three volumes.    Update: Added correction regarding current status and production company of Soul Reviver's Hollywood live-acton film project.

News Tohru Fujisawa's Soul Reviver Manga Gets Live-Action Japanese-Korean Show   posted on 2022-04-05 12:58 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Fujisawa, Manabu Akishige launched manga about bringing dead back to life    Hero's Inc. announced on Tuesday that Tohru Fujisawa and Manabu Akishige's Soul Reviver manga is inspiring an upcoming joint Japanese-South Korean live-action show. The show will debut in over-the-top streaming services in South Korea.    Japanese production company Robot and South Korean production company B.A. Entertainment are co-producing the show, through a partnership facilitated by the Visual Industry Promotion Organization since October of last year.    In the original manga, the dead can be brought back to life, if their souls can be restored before disappearing into the void. Between death and the void is the world of the dead, and two individuals — the former detective Ryūsuke Jin and the dead high school girl Clara Sekimachi — salvage souls in this realm.    Fujisawa created the scenario and original character designs, while Akishige drew the manga. The manga launched in Hero's Inc.'s Monthly Hero's magazine in 2011, and ended it in November 2014 with four volumes.    Shogakukan promoted the third volume with a 3D CG short in April 2013, and Kaizō Hayashi (Maiku Hama films, creative director for 7 Blades game) directed a nine-minute live-action short based on the manga in December 2013. The series also had a Hollywood live-action film adaptation in the works, with Annmarie Sairrino's previous ANEW Entertainment production company no longer moving forward with the film. Sairrino left ANEW following a corporate reorganization in 2017, and the film's production ceased to proceed. Edward Zwick (director, The Last Samurai, Glory, Courage Under Fire) and Marshall Herskovitz (producer, The Last Samurai, Traffic, I Am Sam) were once attached to the film via Herskovitz's The Bedford Falls Compan.    Fujisawa (GTO) began the Soul Reviver South series as the manga's ""second season"" in Monthly Hero's in December 2014, one month after the original manga ended. The second series ended in February 2016 with three volumes.    Update: Added correction regarding current status and production company of Soul Reviver's Hollywood live-acton film project.

Interest Cygames Supports Cat Longevity Research   posted on 2022-04-07 04:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee         ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy.""    Cygames announced on Twitter on Monday that it has made a donation to the AIM Medical Research Institute (abbreviated as IAM), a group dedicated to the research of the AIM protein. The protein is said to have the potential to expand the average lifespan of cats.     株式会社Cygames、血中タンパク質「AIM」に関する研究を行うAIM医学研究所への寄付を実施　～ネコ薬の開発により猫の寿命伸長に貢献～ | 株式会社Cygames https://t.co/kRJemAAADc— Cygames公式アカウント (@Cygames_PR) April 4, 2022     AIM (short for Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage) is a protein found in macrophages. The protein has been shown to be useful in the treatment of kidney diseases, which many domestic cats develop in old age. If administered at a young age, a properly functioning dose of AIM is said to reduce the onset of kidney disease in cats, possibly doubling their average lifespan.    Toru Miyazaki, who heads the research group, had been working on the development of an AIM drug for cats, but was forced to temporarily suspend his research due to funding difficulties. In light of this, Cygames has decided to provide ongoing donation support for the research until the practical application of the drug is realized.     ""The support of companies in fields completely different from medicine and pharmaceuticals is a great encouragement to us,"" Miyazaki commented. ""We will use this donation, along with the many other donations we have received from the general public, to greatly accelerate our research on AIM. All of our researchers will do their utmost to complete the AIM drug as soon as possible.""    Yuito Kimura, Senior Managing Director of Cygames, also commented on the donation: ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy. We are happy that our donation will help them to cure their partners from incurable diseases and save many lives.""    Cygames celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The company has produced games such as Rage of Bahamut and Granblue Fantasy. Cygames established an anime division in March 2015 and the anime production subsidiary Cygames Pictures in April 2016. The company has worked on anime productions inspired by its games including Rage of Bahamut Genesis, Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, Uma Musume Pretty Derby, and Granblue Fantasy the Animation.

Interest Cygames Supports Cat Longevity Research   posted on 2022-04-07 04:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee         ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy.""    Cygames announced on Twitter on Monday that it has made a donation to the AIM Medical Research Institute (abbreviated as IAM), a group dedicated to the research of the AIM protein. The protein is said to have the potential to expand the average lifespan of cats.     株式会社Cygames、血中タンパク質「AIM」に関する研究を行うAIM医学研究所への寄付を実施　～ネコ薬の開発により猫の寿命伸長に貢献～ | 株式会社Cygames https://t.co/kRJemAAADc— Cygames公式アカウント (@Cygames_PR) April 4, 2022     AIM (short for Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage) is a protein found in macrophages. The protein has been shown to be useful in the treatment of kidney diseases, which many domestic cats develop in old age. If administered at a young age, a properly functioning dose of AIM is said to reduce the onset of kidney disease in cats, possibly doubling their average lifespan.    Toru Miyazaki, who heads the research group, had been working on the development of an AIM drug for cats, but was forced to temporarily suspend his research due to funding difficulties. In light of this, Cygames has decided to provide ongoing donation support for the research until the practical application of the drug is realized.     ""The support of companies in fields completely different from medicine and pharmaceuticals is a great encouragement to us,"" Miyazaki commented. ""We will use this donation, along with the many other donations we have received from the general public, to greatly accelerate our research on AIM. All of our researchers will do their utmost to complete the AIM drug as soon as possible.""    Yuito Kimura, Senior Managing Director of Cygames, also commented on the donation: ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy. We are happy that our donation will help them to cure their partners from incurable diseases and save many lives.""    Cygames celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The company has produced games such as Rage of Bahamut and Granblue Fantasy. Cygames established an anime division in March 2015 and the anime production subsidiary Cygames Pictures in April 2016. The company has worked on anime productions inspired by its games including Rage of Bahamut Genesis, Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, Uma Musume Pretty Derby, and Granblue Fantasy the Animation.

Interest Cygames Supports Cat Longevity Research   posted on 2022-04-07 04:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee         ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy.""    Cygames announced on Twitter on Monday that it has made a donation to the AIM Medical Research Institute (abbreviated as IAM), a group dedicated to the research of the AIM protein. The protein is said to have the potential to expand the average lifespan of cats.     株式会社Cygames、血中タンパク質「AIM」に関する研究を行うAIM医学研究所への寄付を実施　～ネコ薬の開発により猫の寿命伸長に貢献～ | 株式会社Cygames https://t.co/kRJemAAADc— Cygames公式アカウント (@Cygames_PR) April 4, 2022     AIM (short for Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage) is a protein found in macrophages. The protein has been shown to be useful in the treatment of kidney diseases, which many domestic cats develop in old age. If administered at a young age, a properly functioning dose of AIM is said to reduce the onset of kidney disease in cats, possibly doubling their average lifespan.    Toru Miyazaki, who heads the research group, had been working on the development of an AIM drug for cats, but was forced to temporarily suspend his research due to funding difficulties. In light of this, Cygames has decided to provide ongoing donation support for the research until the practical application of the drug is realized.     ""The support of companies in fields completely different from medicine and pharmaceuticals is a great encouragement to us,"" Miyazaki commented. ""We will use this donation, along with the many other donations we have received from the general public, to greatly accelerate our research on AIM. All of our researchers will do their utmost to complete the AIM drug as soon as possible.""    Yuito Kimura, Senior Managing Director of Cygames, also commented on the donation: ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy. We are happy that our donation will help them to cure their partners from incurable diseases and save many lives.""    Cygames celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The company has produced games such as Rage of Bahamut and Granblue Fantasy. Cygames established an anime division in March 2015 and the anime production subsidiary Cygames Pictures in April 2016. The company has worked on anime productions inspired by its games including Rage of Bahamut Genesis, Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, Uma Musume Pretty Derby, and Granblue Fantasy the Animation.
