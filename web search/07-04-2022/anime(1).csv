It deals with themes from growing up to the importance of friendship, often along with graphic violence and some sexual undertones.It has been around for decades in Japan and gained a foothold in the West in the 1990s, but reached a new level of popularity around the world in the past few years.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The film follows high school student Yuta OkkotsuNetflix says more than 100 million households around the world watched at least one anime title in the first nine months of 2020, a 50% increase from 2019. Meanwhile, anime only sites like Crunchyroll have also seen a rise in viewers.Shiro Yoshioka, a lecturer in Japanese studies at Newcastle University, says streaming sites have ""lowered the barrier to be a fan of anime significantly and has helped it become more mainstream than it used to be"".Jujutsu Kaisen 0 made almost $15m (£11m) at US and Canadian cinemas last weekend and another £825,000 in the UK and Ireland.'Masterful' film""This is a terrific opening,"" David A Gross, who runs movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, told Reuters. ""Reviews are exceptional for this and for all of Funimation/Crunchyroll movies. They have not missed.""Those reviews included one in The Guardian, which said the ""dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens"".Directed by Sunghoo Park, it has more graphic violence than some previous Japanese animations as a result of its darker themes and tone. The film comes after the success of Demon Slayer, which became the highest-grossing anime film worldwide, making $90m (£68m) outside Japan in 2021 despite being released during the pandemic.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The manga/comic books the film was based on sold more than 60 million copies in JapanCrunchyroll released Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in US cinemas and has seen its streaming numbers go from one million paid subscribers in 2017 to five million last year. Sony bought the company for $1.175bn (£900m) in 2021.Chief content officer Asa Suehira said the growth of streaming and video games had led to ""more fans with a comfort and interest around adult dramatic animation"".Dr Yoshioka believes it is ""the complexity and difference from Western visual media that attract young people to anime"".He adds: ""There is still a mindset in the West that animation is for children, whereas in Japan, the genre is for audiences of all ages, and the content reflects that.""Dr Filippo Cervelli, a lecturer in modern Japanese literature at the SOAS University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), has seen an increase in the number of students writing theses on anime.""This shows how anime are appreciated but are also seen as sources of cultural insights,"" he says. ""Many popular anime show Japanese urban backgrounds, Japanese food and other elements of daily life that can be new and attractive to UK audiences used to different architectures or daily rhythms.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The Guardian described the film as ""bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once""For a growing number of parents, they may wonder whether the content their children are watching is appropriate.Vansh Gulati from Epic Dope, a site dedicated to all things anime, says it should not be confused with hentai - or Japanese animated pornography. ""Many parents think of anime to be porn disguised as aesthetic glitter-covered cartoons,"" he says.He advises that, like any other form of media, parents should monitor what their children watch. They can also read reviews, check age ratings and make sure they don't stray into shows rated for adults.Anna Parker-Naples, a parent of three, thinks anime has its benefits but it's important to know what your children are watching. ""Sometimes the way that death is portrayed, even if it's graphics, can be quite bloody and brutal. I think it's the adult themes woven into some of the stories. We just never know at what point they're going to become overly violent.""We want to make sure we're on board with what they are watching. So quite often, we will watch a few episodes of the series before we let them watch something.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some fans spend a lot of time drawing characters from or inspired by their favourite anime shows or manga booksOne of her children is drawn to the artistry of anime because some of it can be ""quite beautiful"", she adds.""For us, watching our children be inspired by something that they were then wanting to draw and be creative, we quite like that.""For some fans, especially for younger viewers, having something in common with other like-minded people brings about a sense of belonging and acceptance.""I think they sort of self-identify with all the people that watch anime.

I believe that stories have an important role to play in the formation of human beings, that they can stimulate, amaze and inspire their listeners,"" Miyazaki Hayao said in a 2002 interview.So what does this mean to fans?We spoke to three Studio Ghibli superfans who couldn't contain their excitement after hearing the announcement.Image source, Sarah TaylorImage caption, Sarah's favourite Studio Ghibli film is Howl's Moving CastleSarah Taylor was first introduced to the films by her Japanese housemate. ""I saw some artwork on her wall and I thought - 'What is this? This is amazing'.""She showed me the film and I was captivated, it really showed me what Japanese life could look like with a thrilling magical element on top,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.""When I say I love anime people sort of roll their eyes a bit unless they have seen some and understand it. ""People still think it's just cartoons, but they're grown-up films.""'It's the ultimate escapism'We didn't have to look too far to find the next superfan: Laura Bailey is a ""massive anime fan"" - and she's an assistant producer at BBC 1Xtra, round the corner from us at Newsbeat.Image source, AlamyImage caption, My Neighbour Totoro, from 1988, is one of Studio Ghibli's most famous films""It's great to have it on Netflix because people are really getting introduced into anime and are going to be able to watch the classic movies and understand what all the hype is about,"" Laura says. She says the traditional stereotype of someone who watches anime is changing over time. ""I know a lot of rappers like AJ Tracey have spoken about watching anime, I don't think it's like a weird or geeky thing as much as it used to be when I was growing up,"" Laura says.""It's the ultimate escapism, its like a Japanese Disney. It will take you to a different world if you ever grew up with cartoons.""A podcast... all about Studio Ghibli?Yes, you heard it right. Jake Cunningham is co-host of the Ghibliotheque podcast - despite only watching his first Studio Ghibli film only 18 months ago.Each week for the podcast he's given a film to watch by his superfan co-host, and has now watched them all.

These films are perfect.""Before, other than when they'd be on Film4, you'd have to go out and buy the physical media, now it's on Netflix. I can't wait to people to watch those films because they are beautiful in themselves,"" he tells us.""I just wish they'd announced this 18 months ago... it probably would've saved us a bit of money!"" Jake adds.He recently visited Japan to record the podcast and went on a hunt for a ""particular Japanese poster"" from a Studio Ghibli film.Image source, Jake CunninghamImage caption, ""It just shows how the landscape of anime fans is changing""""I think they are totally different to any other animation studio out there, there is so much heart in all of them.""With the films now accessible to anyone with a Netflix account outside of the US, Canada and Japan, Jake thinks lots of people will see just how ahead of their time the Studio Ghibli catalogue was.""They're promoting messages - like environmental comments and self-identity - that I think Western studios are only getting into 20 years later.""Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this storyStreaming TV: 'Not everyone will survive'31 October 2019Spirited Away rules China box office 18 years late26 June 2019Hayao Miyazaki: Japan's godfather of animation?3 December 2016Anime film legend Takahata dies6 April 2018Top StoriesPutin's daughters targeted by US sanctionsPublished1 hour agoSri Lanka president defies calls for his resignationPublished10 hours agoUS, UK and Australia to boost research on hypersonic weaponsPublished22 hours agoFeaturesWhy South Korea struggles to sleepThe Indian behind the VFX company winning Oscars'I saw a Russian soldier shoot my father dead'An execution-style killing on a street in BuchaHow a guitarist saved hundreds on a sinking cruise shipWill France's 'forgotten' workers get support?Brazil at work: Black and held backThe entry-level workers making $100,000The Dutch city testing the future of urban lifeElsewhere on the BBCOne family, 50 years of scandal…The rise and fall of media mogul Robert MaxwellMeet the KhansInside their crazy, fabulous and fast-paced life in their beloved Bolton homeThe importance of sleep...Why does it impact almost every system in the human body?Most Read1Putin's daughters targeted by US sanctions2Sex offender wanted ransom to delete arrest clips3Putin's ultranationalist ally and clown dies at 754Sri Lanka president defies calls for his resignation5Ed Sheeran wins Shape of You copyright case6How a guitarist saved hundreds on a sinking cruise ship7Woman's 999 pizza call over safety fears8Outrage as Delhi meat shops shut for Hindu festival9India condemns Bucha killings in strong statement10Why South Korea struggles to sleepBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2022 BBC.

In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel.

And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her.""

07-04-2022,anime,9,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-49343280,Why I 'married' a cartoon character - BBC News,"Why I 'married' a cartoon characterPublished17 August 2019SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesThere is a word in Japanese for people who are obsessed with video games and anime - otaku. An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names.

Pokémon started life as an 8-bit video game in Japan -  where players capture creatures and store them in pocket-sized capsules (Pokémon is short for ""pocket monsters"") - but has grown into a cultural megahit.By some estimates, Pokémon is now the biggest media franchise in history, worth more than Harry Potter and Star Wars combined. Over its 25-year journey, it has spawned several global crazes, involving celebrities paying millions for trading cards and people walking tens of thousands of kilometres in pursuit of rare monsters. These are the moments when Pokémania swept the globe.Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold!Image source, Tom BatemanImage caption, Pikachu, one of 898 monsters in the Pokémon world, is the most recognisablePokémon started small. The game's developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. ""It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,"" says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games' development team.  He turned out to be right. The series' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version. ""But we never considered selling Pokémon abroad,"" Mr Ishihara says.""People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn't play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.""Image source, Tom BatemanPokémon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pokémon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.""All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that's when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. ""The cool thing about Pokémon is it's a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there'd probably be someone that I know from Pokémon that I could probably crash with. I think that's so cool,"" he says. 16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 secondsOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. The channel, ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"", broadcast a stream of Pokémon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch's built-in chat. ""I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You've got the video, you've got the chat, it was right for something like that,"" says Marcus ""djWHEAT"" Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.Image source, TwitchImage caption, Tens of thousands of players are controlling one character""The streamer's original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I'll begin parsing them into the game and we'll see what chaos this creates,"" he says. The chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.Twitch Plays Pokémon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream's peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream's most beloved Pokémon to be ""released"", meaning they were lost forever. But after 16 days, seven hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds of play, the stream completed the game. In all, 1.16 million people had played, and more than nine million had watched. Marcus Graham believes the ""Pokémon"" part of Twitch Plays Pokémon was the key to success, as the stream combined the simple goals of catching monsters and collecting gym badges with players' nostalgia for the classic game and its cast of familiar characters. ""I really do think that because the game was Pokémon that played a massive part in the explosive virality of it all. It was kind of that perfect storm.""Gotta catch 'em allWhile the world watched millions play Pokémon Red on Twitch, a Japanese software engineer was working on an April Fool's joke. Tatsuo Nomura (who declined to be interviewed for this article) worked for Google's maps division. A Pokémon fan since childhood, Nomura decided to blend the two, hiding Pokémon on a map of the world for users to find. Image source, PG/Bauer-Griffin""Mr Nomura used to find exploits in Pokémon Red and Green when he was a kid, that's how he became interested in computer programming,"" explains the Pokémon Company's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who greenlit the project after receiving a pitch from Google-owned game developer Niantic.""That passion led him to join Google, then Google Maps, and consequently he created Pokémon GO.""The mobile game was an instant success, introducing millions of players to a world of ""augmented reality"" gaming. To play, users must walk around in the real world in order to find and catch Pokémon on their phone screens.One Japanese player, playing under the name Kyarorina, got hooked after his workplace organised a walking competition for its staff.   ""The goal of simply walking turned into an obsession with chasing after rare Pokémon and catching them all,"" he says.The stats tell the full story: since first downloading Pokémon GO in July 2016, he has walked over 31,000km (19,200 miles) and visited more than a million Pokéstops - real-life locations where players can collect in-game items. In 2019, Kyarorina became the first person to catch one million Pokémon in-game. Image source, The Pokemon CompanyImage caption, Some of the most popular characters""Recently I've been spending about eight to 10 hours a day catching Pokémon, about 2,000 a day. I think I'll hit two million by the end of this month and announce it on Twitter,"" he tells the BBC.Pokémon GO's initial popularity was matched by its profitability. In 2020, five years after the game was first released, it saw record revenues of over $1bn (£718m). The free-to-play game makes money both by charging players for items and by charging businesses for the privilege of appearing on the in-game map. For Neriko Doerr and Debra Occhi, cultural anthropologists who co-authored a book on Pokémon GO, the game is evidence of Pokémon's broad appeal - something that can help explain the franchise's success. ""Pokemon GO attracted people who are into going outside, walking around and people who are happy with just collecting Pokemon into the game world, some of whom became very enthusiastic,"" Ms Doerr says.The red pinsAs Pokémon's 25th birthday approached, the franchise once again hit headlines as YouTuber Logan Paul paid $2m for six boxes of vintage Pokémon cards.""This is a newfound obsession of mine and I am so excited to share it with other enthusiasts around the world,"" the controversial entertainer wrote on social media.  Image source, Yvonne Hemsey""Pokemon cards have always been highly prized,"" says Tracy Martin, an expert in valuing post-war collectables. ""This is down to nostalgia and obviously the rarity of a card, but also Pokemon is still very current. It's a phenomenon that seems to grip both children and adults, and that's the main reason why it's still going strong,"" she says. ""That was not what we expected,"" says Pokémon's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who was himself featured on a Pokémon card that last year sold for $50,000.So what does Ishihara expect the next 25 years will bring for Pokémon? ""World domination"" he says, eyes fixed on the red pins that dot his map.

Over its 25-year journey, it has spawned several global crazes, involving celebrities paying millions for trading cards and people walking tens of thousands of kilometres in pursuit of rare monsters. These are the moments when Pokémania swept the globe.Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold!Image source, Tom BatemanImage caption, Pikachu, one of 898 monsters in the Pokémon world, is the most recognisablePokémon started small. The game's developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. ""It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,"" says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games' development team.  He turned out to be right. The series' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version. ""But we never considered selling Pokémon abroad,"" Mr Ishihara says.""People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn't play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.""Image source, Tom BatemanPokémon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pokémon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.""All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that's when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. ""The cool thing about Pokémon is it's a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there'd probably be someone that I know from Pokémon that I could probably crash with. I think that's so cool,"" he says. 16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 secondsOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. The channel, ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"", broadcast a stream of Pokémon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch's built-in chat. ""I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You've got the video, you've got the chat, it was right for something like that,"" says Marcus ""djWHEAT"" Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.Image source, TwitchImage caption, Tens of thousands of players are controlling one character""The streamer's original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I'll begin parsing them into the game and we'll see what chaos this creates,"" he says. The chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.Twitch Plays Pokémon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream's peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream's most beloved Pokémon to be ""released"", meaning they were lost forever. But after 16 days, seven hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds of play, the stream completed the game. In all, 1.16 million people had played, and more than nine million had watched. Marcus Graham believes the ""Pokémon"" part of Twitch Plays Pokémon was the key to success, as the stream combined the simple goals of catching monsters and collecting gym badges with players' nostalgia for the classic game and its cast of familiar characters. ""I really do think that because the game was Pokémon that played a massive part in the explosive virality of it all. It was kind of that perfect storm.""Gotta catch 'em allWhile the world watched millions play Pokémon Red on Twitch, a Japanese software engineer was working on an April Fool's joke. Tatsuo Nomura (who declined to be interviewed for this article) worked for Google's maps division. A Pokémon fan since childhood, Nomura decided to blend the two, hiding Pokémon on a map of the world for users to find. Image source, PG/Bauer-Griffin""Mr Nomura used to find exploits in Pokémon Red and Green when he was a kid, that's how he became interested in computer programming,"" explains the Pokémon Company's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who greenlit the project after receiving a pitch from Google-owned game developer Niantic.""That passion led him to join Google, then Google Maps, and consequently he created Pokémon GO.""The mobile game was an instant success, introducing millions of players to a world of ""augmented reality"" gaming. To play, users must walk around in the real world in order to find and catch Pokémon on their phone screens.One Japanese player, playing under the name Kyarorina, got hooked after his workplace organised a walking competition for its staff.   ""The goal of simply walking turned into an obsession with chasing after rare Pokémon and catching them all,"" he says.The stats tell the full story: since first downloading Pokémon GO in July 2016, he has walked over 31,000km (19,200 miles) and visited more than a million Pokéstops - real-life locations where players can collect in-game items. In 2019, Kyarorina became the first person to catch one million Pokémon in-game. Image source, The Pokemon CompanyImage caption, Some of the most popular characters""Recently I've been spending about eight to 10 hours a day catching Pokémon, about 2,000 a day. I think I'll hit two million by the end of this month and announce it on Twitter,"" he tells the BBC.Pokémon GO's initial popularity was matched by its profitability. In 2020, five years after the game was first released, it saw record revenues of over $1bn (£718m). The free-to-play game makes money both by charging players for items and by charging businesses for the privilege of appearing on the in-game map. For Neriko Doerr and Debra Occhi, cultural anthropologists who co-authored a book on Pokémon GO, the game is evidence of Pokémon's broad appeal - something that can help explain the franchise's success. ""Pokemon GO attracted people who are into going outside, walking around and people who are happy with just collecting Pokemon into the game world, some of whom became very enthusiastic,"" Ms Doerr says.The red pinsAs Pokémon's 25th birthday approached, the franchise once again hit headlines as YouTuber Logan Paul paid $2m for six boxes of vintage Pokémon cards.""This is a newfound obsession of mine and I am so excited to share it with other enthusiasts around the world,"" the controversial entertainer wrote on social media.  Image source, Yvonne Hemsey""Pokemon cards have always been highly prized,"" says Tracy Martin, an expert in valuing post-war collectables. ""This is down to nostalgia and obviously the rarity of a card, but also Pokemon is still very current. It's a phenomenon that seems to grip both children and adults, and that's the main reason why it's still going strong,"" she says. ""That was not what we expected,"" says Pokémon's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who was himself featured on a Pokémon card that last year sold for $50,000.So what does Ishihara expect the next 25 years will bring for Pokémon? ""World domination"" he says, eyes fixed on the red pins that dot his map.

I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself.

To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time.

This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we've seen before.Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The judging panel consists of THE9's Esther Yu, actress Angelababy and rapper Lil Ghost - a former talent show discoveryiQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray.Among the 31 virtual contenders, there's an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show's judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards.Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman.  On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Why I 'married' a cartoon characterThe curious rise of virtual celebritiesK-pop band's panda cuddle raises hackles in ChinaTalent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain's Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China's youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that's why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London's Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend's game character Akali perform 'offline' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year's research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters 'to life'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show's judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they're multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China's Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China's Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show's design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

In 2018, Britain's Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China's youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that's why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London's Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend's game character Akali perform 'offline' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year's research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters 'to life'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show's judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they're multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China's Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China's Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show's design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

She said the man was carrying two boxes that appeared to contain petrol cans.Two students also reported seeing a man on Wednesday evening dressed similarly to the suspect. One of the students said the man resembled Mr Aoba and was lying on a bench approximately 500m (1640ft) away from the office.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Mr Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba had allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their familiesHe was taken to hospital in Kyoto and, on Saturday, transferred to a hospital in Osaka. He has not yet been formally interviewed about his motive as police are waiting for him to recover from his injuries.Public broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but did not know if they were connected to the attack.What happened on Thursday?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT). Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by a blaze, causing people to jump out of windows to escape.Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouting: ""Die!""Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A firefighter inspects the interior of the torched Kyoto Animation buildingKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants - but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.The fire was put out and police investigators searched the site for evidence.Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

She said the man was carrying two boxes that appeared to contain petrol cans.Two students also reported seeing a man on Wednesday evening dressed similarly to the suspect. One of the students said the man resembled Mr Aoba and was lying on a bench approximately 500m (1640ft) away from the office.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Mr Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba had allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their familiesHe was taken to hospital in Kyoto and, on Saturday, transferred to a hospital in Osaka.

Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but did not know if they were connected to the attack.What happened on Thursday?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT). Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by a blaze, causing people to jump out of windows to escape.Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouting: ""Die!""Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A firefighter inspects the interior of the torched Kyoto Animation buildingKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants - but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.The fire was put out and police investigators searched the site for evidence.Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

Studio ​Ghibli, which he co-founded, is often compared with Disney – it will even be opening a theme park in 2022. His animations never lost sense of the magical despite being so vivid and detailed in their realism. RecommendedBugs Bunny animator Bob Givens dies aged 99The youngest of seven siblings, Takahata was born in Ujiyamada in Japan’s Mie Prefecture, but spent his childhood in Okayama. He was nine years old when the city was targeted in a US air raid. Takahata and his sister fled for their lives, barefoot and still in pyjamas.It was while studying French literature at the University of Tokyo that Takahata first became interested in animation.He was inspired by Paul Grimault’s film, Le Roi et l’Oiseau (The King and the Mockingbird) for which his favourite poet, Jacques Prévert, wrote the screenplay. (Nearly half a century later, Takahata would publish a collection of his personal translations of Prévert’s poetry.) Critics applauded 1988’s ‘Grave of the Fireflies’ as one of the greatest war films ever made (Studio Ghibli) (STUDIO GHIBLI)Upon graduating, Takahata joined Toei Animation, working as assistant director on several of the studio’s shows before being invited to direct a feature of his own. Unfortunately, while Takahata’s directorial debut, The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968), would eventually be considered a classic, it was a commercial flop.Takahata was demoted and, frustrated by the status quo, he quit. He was followed by friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki. The pair collaborated on several projects during the 1970s and when Miyazaki’s manga found commercial and critical success in the early Eighties, he invited Takahata to join him in founding a new studio.Daisy Ridley and Dev Patel voiced characters in 2016’s 25th anniversary release of ‘Only Yesterday’The result was Studio Ghibli, named for a hot desert wind, signifying that Miyazaki and Takahata intended to “blow a new wind through the anime industry”.To begin with, Takahata worked as producer to Miyazaki’s director but in 1988, Takahata returned to directing himself with Grave of the Fireflies.The film was based on an Akiyuki Nosaka short story but also drew on Takahata’s own childhood experiences of the Second World War.Takahata was known for using a pale and watery colour palette, as in ‘The Tale of the Princess Kaguya’ (Studio Ghibli)Critic Roger Ebert wrote of the film: “Yes, it’s a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.” Grave of the Fireflies established Studio Ghibli’s reputation around the world. Takahata went on to direct Only Yesterday (1991) and Pom Poko (1994), while the studio’s international importance was further cemented with Miyazaki-directed hits Spirited Away (2001) and Howl’s Moving Castle (2004).Studio Ghibli’s success led to it being dubbed “Japanese Disney”.RecommendedAnita Shreve: American author who wrote about loss and loveThe life of anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-MandelaBill Maynard: Comedian and actor who played Greengrass in ‘Heartbeat’However, the relationship between Takahata and Miyazaki was not always easy and they gradually stopped working together. In 2015, Takahata said: “It wasn’t that I didn’t like what he was doing, I just couldn’t compete with him. I was very conscious of making films that he would steer clear of.” Takahata was perhaps referring to his three-hour long documentary on the canal system of Yanagawa. The two men had very different styles. Colleague Kazuyoshi Tanaka said: “Miyazaki does everything on time ... Takahata has a freer lifestyle. If we didn’t call him up, he could disappear until sunset ... he forgets about time and place when he is in deep thought ... is meticulous in his work, and never compromises quality in the face of deadlines.”Reviewing The Tale of the Princess of Kaguya for The Independent in 2015, Geoffrey Macnab applauded “its difference to Hollywood animation. It has a delicacy and a hand-crafted feel that you won’t find in the latest DreamWorks or Pixar blockbuster. Instead of brash primary colours, Takahata uses a pale and watery palette.”He was, ultimately, far from Disney.Isao Takahata, film director, born 9 October 1935, died 5 April 2018Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

Studio ​Ghibli, which he co-founded, is often compared with Disney – it will even be opening a theme park in 2022. His animations never lost sense of the magical despite being so vivid and detailed in their realism. RecommendedBugs Bunny animator Bob Givens dies aged 99The youngest of seven siblings, Takahata was born in Ujiyamada in Japan’s Mie Prefecture, but spent his childhood in Okayama. He was nine years old when the city was targeted in a US air raid. Takahata and his sister fled for their lives, barefoot and still in pyjamas.It was while studying French literature at the University of Tokyo that Takahata first became interested in animation.He was inspired by Paul Grimault’s film, Le Roi et l’Oiseau (The King and the Mockingbird) for which his favourite poet, Jacques Prévert, wrote the screenplay. (Nearly half a century later, Takahata would publish a collection of his personal translations of Prévert’s poetry.) Critics applauded 1988’s ‘Grave of the Fireflies’ as one of the greatest war films ever made (Studio Ghibli) (STUDIO GHIBLI)Upon graduating, Takahata joined Toei Animation, working as assistant director on several of the studio’s shows before being invited to direct a feature of his own. Unfortunately, while Takahata’s directorial debut, The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968), would eventually be considered a classic, it was a commercial flop.Takahata was demoted and, frustrated by the status quo, he quit. He was followed by friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki. The pair collaborated on several projects during the 1970s and when Miyazaki’s manga found commercial and critical success in the early Eighties, he invited Takahata to join him in founding a new studio.Daisy Ridley and Dev Patel voiced characters in 2016’s 25th anniversary release of ‘Only Yesterday’The result was Studio Ghibli, named for a hot desert wind, signifying that Miyazaki and Takahata intended to “blow a new wind through the anime industry”.To begin with, Takahata worked as producer to Miyazaki’s director but in 1988, Takahata returned to directing himself with Grave of the Fireflies.The film was based on an Akiyuki Nosaka short story but also drew on Takahata’s own childhood experiences of the Second World War.Takahata was known for using a pale and watery colour palette, as in ‘The Tale of the Princess Kaguya’ (Studio Ghibli)Critic Roger Ebert wrote of the film: “Yes, it’s a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.” Grave of the Fireflies established Studio Ghibli’s reputation around the world. Takahata went on to direct Only Yesterday (1991) and Pom Poko (1994), while the studio’s international importance was further cemented with Miyazaki-directed hits Spirited Away (2001) and Howl’s Moving Castle (2004).Studio Ghibli’s success led to it being dubbed “Japanese Disney”.RecommendedAnita Shreve: American author who wrote about loss and loveThe life of anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-MandelaBill Maynard: Comedian and actor who played Greengrass in ‘Heartbeat’However, the relationship between Takahata and Miyazaki was not always easy and they gradually stopped working together. In 2015, Takahata said: “It wasn’t that I didn’t like what he was doing, I just couldn’t compete with him. I was very conscious of making films that he would steer clear of.” Takahata was perhaps referring to his three-hour long documentary on the canal system of Yanagawa. The two men had very different styles. Colleague Kazuyoshi Tanaka said: “Miyazaki does everything on time ... Takahata has a freer lifestyle. If we didn’t call him up, he could disappear until sunset ... he forgets about time and place when he is in deep thought ... is meticulous in his work, and never compromises quality in the face of deadlines.”Reviewing The Tale of the Princess of Kaguya for The Independent in 2015, Geoffrey Macnab applauded “its difference to Hollywood animation.

How will it change us? And how close is “close”? Ghost in the Shell imagines a futuristic, hi-tech but grimy and ghetto-ridden Japanese metropolis populated by people, robots, and technologically-enhanced human cyborgs.Beyond the superhuman strength, resilience, and X-ray vision provided by bodily enhancements, one of the most transformative aspects of this world is the idea of brain augmentation, that as cyborgs we might have two brains rather than one. Our biological brain – the “ghost” in the “shell” – would interface via neural implants to powerful embedded computers that would give us lightening fast reactions and heightened powers of reasoning, learning and memory.First written as a Manga comic series in 1989 during the early days of the internet, Ghost in the Shell’s creator, Japanese artist Masamune Shirow, foresaw that this brain-computer interface would overcome the fundamental limitation of the human condition: that our minds are trapped inside our heads. In Shirow’s transhuman future our minds would be free to roam, relaying thoughts and imaginings to other networked brains, entering via the cloud into distant devices and sensors, even “deep diving” the mind of another in order to understand and share their experiences.Shirow’s stories also pin-pointed some of the dangers of this giant technological leap. In a world where knowledge is power, these brain-computer interfaces would create new tools for government surveillance and control, and new kinds of crime such as “mind-jacking” – the remote control of another’s thoughts and actions. Nevertheless there was also a spiritual side to Shirow’s narrative: that the cyborg condition might be the next step in our evolution, and that the widening of perspective and the merging of individuality from a networking of minds could be a path to enlightenment.Lost in translationBorrowing heavily from Ghost in the Shell’s re-telling by director Mamoru Oshii in his classic 1995 animated film version, the newly arrived Hollywood cinematic interpretation stars Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cyborg working for Section 9, a government-run security organisation charged with fighting corruption and terrorism. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the new film is visually stunning and the storyline lovingly recreates some of the best scenes from the original anime.Sadly though, Sanders’ movie pulls its punches around the core question of how this technology could change the human condition. Indeed, if casting Western actors in most key roles wasn’t enough, the new film also engages in a form of cultural appropriation by superimposing the myth of the American all-action hero – who you are is defined by what you do – on a character who is almost the complete antithesis of that notion.Major fights the battles of her masters with increasing reluctance, questioning the actions asked of her, drawn to escape and contemplation. This is no action hero, but someone trying to piece together fragments of meaning from within her cyborg existence with which to assemble a worthwhile life.✕Ghost In The ShellA scene midway through the film shows, even more bluntly, the central role of memory in creating the self. We see the complete breakdown of a man who, having been mind-jacked, faces the realisation that his identity is built on false memories of a life never lived, and a family who never existed. The 1995 anime insists that we are individuals only because of our memories. While the new film retains much of the same story line, it refuses to follow the inference. Rather than being defined by our memories, Major’s voice tells us that “we cling to memories as if they define us, but what we do defines us”. Perhaps this is meant to be reassuring, but to me it is both confusing and unfaithful to the spirit of the original tale.The new film also backs away from another key idea of Shirow’s work, that the human mind – even the human species – are, in essence, information. Where the 1995 anime talked of the possibility of leaving the physical body – the shell – elevating consciousness to a higher plane and “becoming part of all things”, the remake has only veiled hints that such a merging minds, or a melding of the human mind with the internet, could be either positive or transformational.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upOpen livesIn the real world, the notion of networked minds is already upon us. Touchscreens, keypads, cameras, mobile, the cloud: we are more and more directly and instantly linked to a widening circle of people, while opening up our personal lives to surveillance and potential manipulation by governments, advertisers, or worse.Brain-computer interfaces are also on their way. There are already brain implants that can mitigate some of the symptoms of brain conditions, from Parkinson’s disease to depression. Others are being developed to overcome sensory impairments such as blindness or to control a paralysed limb. On the other hand, the remote control of behaviour using implanted brain stimulators has been demonstrated in several animal species, a frightening technology that could be applied to humans if someone were to choose to misuse it in that way.The possibility of voluntarily networking our minds is also here. Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences. The fusion of such systems with the human brain is not possible with today’s technology – but it is imaginable in the decades to come. Were an electronic implant developed that could vastly improve your memory and intelligence, would you be tempted? Such technologies may be on the horizon, and science fiction imaginings such as Ghost in the Shell suggest that their power to fundamentally change the human condition should not be underestimated.Tony Prescott is a professor of cognitive neuroscience and Director of the Sheffield Robotics Institute, University of SheffieldThis article first appeared on The Conversation (theconversation.com)Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

How will it change us? And how close is “close”? Ghost in the Shell imagines a futuristic, hi-tech but grimy and ghetto-ridden Japanese metropolis populated by people, robots, and technologically-enhanced human cyborgs.Beyond the superhuman strength, resilience, and X-ray vision provided by bodily enhancements, one of the most transformative aspects of this world is the idea of brain augmentation, that as cyborgs we might have two brains rather than one. Our biological brain – the “ghost” in the “shell” – would interface via neural implants to powerful embedded computers that would give us lightening fast reactions and heightened powers of reasoning, learning and memory.First written as a Manga comic series in 1989 during the early days of the internet, Ghost in the Shell’s creator, Japanese artist Masamune Shirow, foresaw that this brain-computer interface would overcome the fundamental limitation of the human condition: that our minds are trapped inside our heads. In Shirow’s transhuman future our minds would be free to roam, relaying thoughts and imaginings to other networked brains, entering via the cloud into distant devices and sensors, even “deep diving” the mind of another in order to understand and share their experiences.Shirow’s stories also pin-pointed some of the dangers of this giant technological leap. In a world where knowledge is power, these brain-computer interfaces would create new tools for government surveillance and control, and new kinds of crime such as “mind-jacking” – the remote control of another’s thoughts and actions. Nevertheless there was also a spiritual side to Shirow’s narrative: that the cyborg condition might be the next step in our evolution, and that the widening of perspective and the merging of individuality from a networking of minds could be a path to enlightenment.Lost in translationBorrowing heavily from Ghost in the Shell’s re-telling by director Mamoru Oshii in his classic 1995 animated film version, the newly arrived Hollywood cinematic interpretation stars Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cyborg working for Section 9, a government-run security organisation charged with fighting corruption and terrorism. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the new film is visually stunning and the storyline lovingly recreates some of the best scenes from the original anime.Sadly though, Sanders’ movie pulls its punches around the core question of how this technology could change the human condition. Indeed, if casting Western actors in most key roles wasn’t enough, the new film also engages in a form of cultural appropriation by superimposing the myth of the American all-action hero – who you are is defined by what you do – on a character who is almost the complete antithesis of that notion.Major fights the battles of her masters with increasing reluctance, questioning the actions asked of her, drawn to escape and contemplation. This is no action hero, but someone trying to piece together fragments of meaning from within her cyborg existence with which to assemble a worthwhile life.✕Ghost In The ShellA scene midway through the film shows, even more bluntly, the central role of memory in creating the self. We see the complete breakdown of a man who, having been mind-jacked, faces the realisation that his identity is built on false memories of a life never lived, and a family who never existed. The 1995 anime insists that we are individuals only because of our memories. While the new film retains much of the same story line, it refuses to follow the inference. Rather than being defined by our memories, Major’s voice tells us that “we cling to memories as if they define us, but what we do defines us”. Perhaps this is meant to be reassuring, but to me it is both confusing and unfaithful to the spirit of the original tale.The new film also backs away from another key idea of Shirow’s work, that the human mind – even the human species – are, in essence, information. Where the 1995 anime talked of the possibility of leaving the physical body – the shell – elevating consciousness to a higher plane and “becoming part of all things”, the remake has only veiled hints that such a merging minds, or a melding of the human mind with the internet, could be either positive or transformational.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upOpen livesIn the real world, the notion of networked minds is already upon us. Touchscreens, keypads, cameras, mobile, the cloud: we are more and more directly and instantly linked to a widening circle of people, while opening up our personal lives to surveillance and potential manipulation by governments, advertisers, or worse.Brain-computer interfaces are also on their way. There are already brain implants that can mitigate some of the symptoms of brain conditions, from Parkinson’s disease to depression. Others are being developed to overcome sensory impairments such as blindness or to control a paralysed limb. On the other hand, the remote control of behaviour using implanted brain stimulators has been demonstrated in several animal species, a frightening technology that could be applied to humans if someone were to choose to misuse it in that way.The possibility of voluntarily networking our minds is also here. Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences. The fusion of such systems with the human brain is not possible with today’s technology – but it is imaginable in the decades to come.

07-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/ghostintheshell-a7665671.html,Ghost in the Shell falls short of anime original | The Independent | The Independent,"How closely will we live with the technology we use in the future? How will it change us? And how close is “close”? Ghost in the Shell imagines a futuristic, hi-tech but grimy and ghetto-ridden Japanese metropolis populated by people, robots, and technologically-enhanced human cyborgs.Beyond the superhuman strength, resilience, and X-ray vision provided by bodily enhancements, one of the most transformative aspects of this world is the idea of brain augmentation, that as cyborgs we might have two brains rather than one. Our biological brain – the “ghost” in the “shell” – would interface via neural implants to powerful embedded computers that would give us lightening fast reactions and heightened powers of reasoning, learning and memory.First written as a Manga comic series in 1989 during the early days of the internet, Ghost in the Shell’s creator, Japanese artist Masamune Shirow, foresaw that this brain-computer interface would overcome the fundamental limitation of the human condition: that our minds are trapped inside our heads. In Shirow’s transhuman future our minds would be free to roam, relaying thoughts and imaginings to other networked brains, entering via the cloud into distant devices and sensors, even “deep diving” the mind of another in order to understand and share their experiences.Shirow’s stories also pin-pointed some of the dangers of this giant technological leap. In a world where knowledge is power, these brain-computer interfaces would create new tools for government surveillance and control, and new kinds of crime such as “mind-jacking” – the remote control of another’s thoughts and actions. Nevertheless there was also a spiritual side to Shirow’s narrative: that the cyborg condition might be the next step in our evolution, and that the widening of perspective and the merging of individuality from a networking of minds could be a path to enlightenment.Lost in translationBorrowing heavily from Ghost in the Shell’s re-telling by director Mamoru Oshii in his classic 1995 animated film version, the newly arrived Hollywood cinematic interpretation stars Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cyborg working for Section 9, a government-run security organisation charged with fighting corruption and terrorism. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the new film is visually stunning and the storyline lovingly recreates some of the best scenes from the original anime.Sadly though, Sanders’ movie pulls its punches around the core question of how this technology could change the human condition. Indeed, if casting Western actors in most key roles wasn’t enough, the new film also engages in a form of cultural appropriation by superimposing the myth of the American all-action hero – who you are is defined by what you do – on a character who is almost the complete antithesis of that notion.Major fights the battles of her masters with increasing reluctance, questioning the actions asked of her, drawn to escape and contemplation. This is no action hero, but someone trying to piece together fragments of meaning from within her cyborg existence with which to assemble a worthwhile life.✕Ghost In The ShellA scene midway through the film shows, even more bluntly, the central role of memory in creating the self. We see the complete breakdown of a man who, having been mind-jacked, faces the realisation that his identity is built on false memories of a life never lived, and a family who never existed. The 1995 anime insists that we are individuals only because of our memories. While the new film retains much of the same story line, it refuses to follow the inference. Rather than being defined by our memories, Major’s voice tells us that “we cling to memories as if they define us, but what we do defines us”. Perhaps this is meant to be reassuring, but to me it is both confusing and unfaithful to the spirit of the original tale.The new film also backs away from another key idea of Shirow’s work, that the human mind – even the human species – are, in essence, information. Where the 1995 anime talked of the possibility of leaving the physical body – the shell – elevating consciousness to a higher plane and “becoming part of all things”, the remake has only veiled hints that such a merging minds, or a melding of the human mind with the internet, could be either positive or transformational.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upOpen livesIn the real world, the notion of networked minds is already upon us. Touchscreens, keypads, cameras, mobile, the cloud: we are more and more directly and instantly linked to a widening circle of people, while opening up our personal lives to surveillance and potential manipulation by governments, advertisers, or worse.Brain-computer interfaces are also on their way. There are already brain implants that can mitigate some of the symptoms of brain conditions, from Parkinson’s disease to depression. Others are being developed to overcome sensory impairments such as blindness or to control a paralysed limb. On the other hand, the remote control of behaviour using implanted brain stimulators has been demonstrated in several animal species, a frightening technology that could be applied to humans if someone were to choose to misuse it in that way.The possibility of voluntarily networking our minds is also here. Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences. The fusion of such systems with the human brain is not possible with today’s technology – but it is imaginable in the decades to come. Were an electronic implant developed that could vastly improve your memory and intelligence, would you be tempted? Such technologies may be on the horizon, and science fiction imaginings such as Ghost in the Shell suggest that their power to fundamentally change the human condition should not be underestimated.Tony Prescott is a professor of cognitive neuroscience and Director of the Sheffield Robotics Institute, University of SheffieldThis article first appeared on The Conversation (theconversation.com)",positive,en,{}

The style spans numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. From ultra-violent revenge tales and “chick flick-style” romances to emotional musings on adolescence and premises so wacky it’s tricky to describe them – anime has it all. In a year where we’ve needed new forms of entertainment more than ever, people’s viewing palettes have expanded to encompass new genres and new languages – but if you’re yet to try anime then you can find a list below of titles to start with. Spirited Away is just the tip of a beautifully animated iceberg. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no YaibaDemon Slayer is one of the most successful anime shows right now. Its film adaptation last year became Japan’s biggest box office hit ever, usurping Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away after two decades at the top. Demon Slayer tells the story of a young boy Tanjiro Kamado who seeks revenge after his family is slaughtered by demons who have also cursed his younger sister Nezuko. Demon Slayer (Netflix)Your Lie in AprilNot every anime is violent or action-packed; this tearjerker has more romantic inclinations. When a young piano prodigy named Kousei loses his mother – with whom he had a complicated relationship – he finds himself suddenly unable to hear the sound of his own playing. Then he meets Kaori Miyazono who helps him rediscover his passion for piano. The emotional component is only one aspect of the show’s appeal; its aesthetic as well as its musical qualities are second to none.NarutoIf you want to really sink your teeth into anime, the Naruto franchise is a good place to start. Naruto spans 720 episodes, 11 animated specials, 11 films and 700 chapters of manga. The show’s premise is simple enough: Naruto Uzumaki is a young ninja who works with friends to complete various missions. Naruto is one of the most beloved anime of all time, known for its character development and action sequences. Your Lie in April (Netflix)Devilman CrybabyThe limited series consists of only 10 episodes, meaning you can knock out Devilman Crybaby in one sitting. Equal parts nihilistic and tragic, the series is a testament to just how narratively rich anime can be. Worlds collide when Akira becomes Devilman, a hybrid-being with the power of a demon and a human soul. The series is infinitely less cheesy than its log-line admittedly sounds. ParasyteIn an unexpected turn of events, a teenager – Shinichi – and an alien worm – Migi – join forces to battle an onslaught of parasites that threaten to consume humans and take over the earth. Horror, gore and an offbeat sense of humour await viewers who stick it out past the absurd synopsis. Devilman Crybaby (Netflix)BakiNetflix describes Baki in two words: violent and exciting. Suffice to say, the series delivers on both. The show is a long-running franchise – based on Keisuke Itagaki’s popular manga Baki The Grappler – that has been given a new lease of life thanks to the streaming giant. Taking place directly after the events of the original anime, Baki is an outrageous and fun ride about a young martial arts master who must evade five death row convicts who are out to get him. Food Wars! Shokugeki No SomaIt’s difficult to describe the premise of Food Wars! without putting prospective viewers off. An aspiring young chef Yukihira Soma studies at the Totsuki Culinary Academy, where he faces off with other budding chefs in ridiculously over-the-top cooking battles that are called “food wars”. Slapstick comedy and a chef’s attention to detail make for a thoroughly entertaining, if bizarre, viewing experience. Be warned though, the idea of a “foodgasm” – a tasting experience so fulfilling, it’s described as sexual – is depicted rather graphically in this series.Food Wars! Shokugeki No Soma (Netflix)Your NameAlthough Your Name is a film and not a show, it would be remiss to leave this masterpiece off any anime list. This romantic fantasy film will win over anyone with lingering reservations about a beginner’s guide to anime. The premise is simple enough (a bored girl living in the countryside and a high-school boy in Tokyo suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies), but is brought to life through stunning animation and superb voice acting. Also available to watch on Netflix is The Garden of Words by the same director Makoto Shinkai.

The style spans numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. From ultra-violent revenge tales and “chick flick-style” romances to emotional musings on adolescence and premises so wacky it’s tricky to describe them – anime has it all. In a year where we’ve needed new forms of entertainment more than ever, people’s viewing palettes have expanded to encompass new genres and new languages – but if you’re yet to try anime then you can find a list below of titles to start with. Spirited Away is just the tip of a beautifully animated iceberg. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no YaibaDemon Slayer is one of the most successful anime shows right now. Its film adaptation last year became Japan’s biggest box office hit ever, usurping Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away after two decades at the top. Demon Slayer tells the story of a young boy Tanjiro Kamado who seeks revenge after his family is slaughtered by demons who have also cursed his younger sister Nezuko. Demon Slayer (Netflix)Your Lie in AprilNot every anime is violent or action-packed; this tearjerker has more romantic inclinations. When a young piano prodigy named Kousei loses his mother – with whom he had a complicated relationship – he finds himself suddenly unable to hear the sound of his own playing. Then he meets Kaori Miyazono who helps him rediscover his passion for piano. The emotional component is only one aspect of the show’s appeal; its aesthetic as well as its musical qualities are second to none.NarutoIf you want to really sink your teeth into anime, the Naruto franchise is a good place to start. Naruto spans 720 episodes, 11 animated specials, 11 films and 700 chapters of manga. The show’s premise is simple enough: Naruto Uzumaki is a young ninja who works with friends to complete various missions. Naruto is one of the most beloved anime of all time, known for its character development and action sequences. Your Lie in April (Netflix)Devilman CrybabyThe limited series consists of only 10 episodes, meaning you can knock out Devilman Crybaby in one sitting. Equal parts nihilistic and tragic, the series is a testament to just how narratively rich anime can be. Worlds collide when Akira becomes Devilman, a hybrid-being with the power of a demon and a human soul. The series is infinitely less cheesy than its log-line admittedly sounds. ParasyteIn an unexpected turn of events, a teenager – Shinichi – and an alien worm – Migi – join forces to battle an onslaught of parasites that threaten to consume humans and take over the earth. Horror, gore and an offbeat sense of humour await viewers who stick it out past the absurd synopsis. Devilman Crybaby (Netflix)BakiNetflix describes Baki in two words: violent and exciting. Suffice to say, the series delivers on both. The show is a long-running franchise – based on Keisuke Itagaki’s popular manga Baki The Grappler – that has been given a new lease of life thanks to the streaming giant. Taking place directly after the events of the original anime, Baki is an outrageous and fun ride about a young martial arts master who must evade five death row convicts who are out to get him. Food Wars! Shokugeki No SomaIt’s difficult to describe the premise of Food Wars! without putting prospective viewers off. An aspiring young chef Yukihira Soma studies at the Totsuki Culinary Academy, where he faces off with other budding chefs in ridiculously over-the-top cooking battles that are called “food wars”. Slapstick comedy and a chef’s attention to detail make for a thoroughly entertaining, if bizarre, viewing experience. Be warned though, the idea of a “foodgasm” – a tasting experience so fulfilling, it’s described as sexual – is depicted rather graphically in this series.Food Wars! Shokugeki No Soma (Netflix)Your NameAlthough Your Name is a film and not a show, it would be remiss to leave this masterpiece off any anime list. This romantic fantasy film will win over anyone with lingering reservations about a beginner’s guide to anime. The premise is simple enough (a bored girl living in the countryside and a high-school boy in Tokyo suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies), but is brought to life through stunning animation and superb voice acting.

Naruto spans 720 episodes, 11 animated specials, 11 films and 700 chapters of manga. The show’s premise is simple enough: Naruto Uzumaki is a young ninja who works with friends to complete various missions. Naruto is one of the most beloved anime of all time, known for its character development and action sequences. Your Lie in April (Netflix)Devilman CrybabyThe limited series consists of only 10 episodes, meaning you can knock out Devilman Crybaby in one sitting. Equal parts nihilistic and tragic, the series is a testament to just how narratively rich anime can be. Worlds collide when Akira becomes Devilman, a hybrid-being with the power of a demon and a human soul. The series is infinitely less cheesy than its log-line admittedly sounds. ParasyteIn an unexpected turn of events, a teenager – Shinichi – and an alien worm – Migi – join forces to battle an onslaught of parasites that threaten to consume humans and take over the earth. Horror, gore and an offbeat sense of humour await viewers who stick it out past the absurd synopsis. Devilman Crybaby (Netflix)BakiNetflix describes Baki in two words: violent and exciting. Suffice to say, the series delivers on both. The show is a long-running franchise – based on Keisuke Itagaki’s popular manga Baki The Grappler – that has been given a new lease of life thanks to the streaming giant. Taking place directly after the events of the original anime, Baki is an outrageous and fun ride about a young martial arts master who must evade five death row convicts who are out to get him. Food Wars! Shokugeki No SomaIt’s difficult to describe the premise of Food Wars! without putting prospective viewers off. An aspiring young chef Yukihira Soma studies at the Totsuki Culinary Academy, where he faces off with other budding chefs in ridiculously over-the-top cooking battles that are called “food wars”. Slapstick comedy and a chef’s attention to detail make for a thoroughly entertaining, if bizarre, viewing experience. Be warned though, the idea of a “foodgasm” – a tasting experience so fulfilling, it’s described as sexual – is depicted rather graphically in this series.Food Wars! Shokugeki No Soma (Netflix)Your NameAlthough Your Name is a film and not a show, it would be remiss to leave this masterpiece off any anime list. This romantic fantasy film will win over anyone with lingering reservations about a beginner’s guide to anime. The premise is simple enough (a bored girl living in the countryside and a high-school boy in Tokyo suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies), but is brought to life through stunning animation and superb voice acting. Also available to watch on Netflix is The Garden of Words by the same director Makoto Shinkai. ",positive,en,{}

The series has been so far extremely difficult for UK fans to get their hands on, despite being a well-respected and influential entry into the genre. Airing between 1995 and 1996, the show takes place in an imagined future of 2015, when Tokyo 3 comes under attack from powerful creatures known as the Angels. Shinji Ikari is chosen to pilot the Humanoid Decisive Weapon Evangelion, a giant bio-machine mecha that is humanity's only way to fight back. RecommendedWhat the critics are saying about Netflix's 'bonkers' Christmas filmSatanic Temple reaches 'amicable' agreement in Sabrina copyright rowEvery movie and TV show coming to Netflix in DecemberShinji must help protect the human race, while also discovering the nature of the Angels, and what drives their destruction. Two accompanying films, Evangelion: Death True² and The End of Evangelion will also debut on Netflix. The series is set to debut in spring on next year. Also debuting on Netflix are Rilakkuma and Kaoru, launching 19 April 2019; Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac, launching summer 2019; 7Seeds, launching April 2019; and Ultraman, launching 1 April 2019.

To say that this is a risky venture would be an understatement. As the first anime ever to be broadcast in the United States, thanks to Adult Swim, it’s considered by many in the West (myself included) as their gateway into the world of Japanese animation. Its unique characters, setting and storyline, sublime score and finite run time (one season and one movie) is something that simply doesn’t come along very often and I urge each and every one of you to watch it. But this news raises a very interesting question: why produce a live-action remake?Cowboy Bebop - TrailerA Bebop live-action movie has been gossiped about for years on internet fan forums and respectable news sites, with actors such as Keanu Reeves rumoured to play Spike Spiegel in a Western adaptation. But, as with many internet rumours, these never came to pass. Clearly, it took a giant like Netflix (and Netflix’s money) to finally take the plunge and reproduce what many believe to be a near-sacred chapter of anime‘s history. For die-hard fans, and those who appreciate the overwhelming contribution Bebop has made to anime – and to how anime is perceived in the West – news of a live-action remake could be a cause of concern. However, there are glimmers of hope; Shinichiro Watanabe, Bebop’s original director has been brought on as a consultant on the project, which, if they listen to his guidance, will make the world of difference. His follow-ups of Samurai Champloo and Kids on the Slope are masterpieces, and Netflix getting him on the payroll is probably one of the most sensible aspects of this somewhat crazy project. However, the likes of set designers Shoji Kawamori and Isamu Imakake, and mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane from the original anime all, at present anyway, seem missing from this initial announcement. Yes, Mr Watanabe was the spark that made the Bebop and Swordfish fly, but without the geniuses who helped craft his world, the ships and vehicles and the tech on display – we could be left with a lifeless series dressed up scraps trying to cosplay as its elder brother.When anime live-action remakes are done badly, or merely half-baked, they’re excruciating to watch. Take, for instance, the Dragon Ball Z movie or the slow-motion car-crash that was M Night Shyamalan‘s The Last Airbender. But, despite the overwhelming evidence that live-action anime adaptations or remakes don’t work, there have been some diamonds in the rough, and Bebop may turn out to be one of them. Shusuke Kaneko’s Death Note movies were, unlike the Netflix adaptation, a fairly faithful re-tread of the original manga and anime. This year’s Bleach movie, adapted from Kubo Tite’s hugely successful Shonen Jump manga, landed surprisingly well with both fans and newcomers alike (you can even watch it on Netflix). And, Park Chan-wook‘s incredible Oldboy is a hammer to the face of anyone who says that live-action adaptations don’t work – Oldboy was, in fact, a crime manga from 1996. Another detail that could make or break this venture for Netflix is the music – an aspect that many argue is the lifeblood of Cowboy Bebop. The amazing soundtrack written by Yoko Kanno and performed by her band Seatbelts raised Bebop from an exceptional anime to the high pedestal that fans place it on 30 years later. As you can probably tell from the title, the music is integral to the lore and fabric of the entire series. You could even go so far to say that remaking Bebop with a new soundtrack wouldn’t work – the songs are as much a part of the characters a their names and story arc themselves. Many will breathe a sigh of relief if Netflix announced that they were simply going to re-use Yoko Kanno and Seatbelts recordings, but I fear we may have to endure a “re-imagined” version of the opening theme “Tank”.Personally, I feel no one really asked for a live action re-make. When speaking to someone about “where to start with anime” the first answer is almost always stream Bebop - it’s 26 sessions (episodes) of pure perfection and an excellent starting place for anyone in the gargantuan world of anime. Netflix was already golden in many fans’ eyes for simply licensing the sub and dub of the series and streaming it on their service – we no longer had to go hunting for the DVD box sets. Which raises the real question: who is this remake for? I doubt it’s for the fans, despite having no new Bebop since 2003 they’re not crying out for more. It’s not for people who have never seen the series, unless Netflix has managed to create some sort of mind reading machine they haven’t told us about. So, is this live-action remake simply be for people who don’t like watching anime or animated shows? If that’s the case, who are these people, what do they have against animation and how can they ignore a plethora of interesting stories, settings and characters simply because of how they’re produced?Whatever happens, it seems thanks to Netflix we really will “see you space cowboy…”Sunrise / Netflix (Sunrise / Netflix) Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

To say that this is a risky venture would be an understatement. As the first anime ever to be broadcast in the United States, thanks to Adult Swim, it’s considered by many in the West (myself included) as their gateway into the world of Japanese animation. Its unique characters, setting and storyline, sublime score and finite run time (one season and one movie) is something that simply doesn’t come along very often and I urge each and every one of you to watch it. But this news raises a very interesting question: why produce a live-action remake?Cowboy Bebop - TrailerA Bebop live-action movie has been gossiped about for years on internet fan forums and respectable news sites, with actors such as Keanu Reeves rumoured to play Spike Spiegel in a Western adaptation. But, as with many internet rumours, these never came to pass. Clearly, it took a giant like Netflix (and Netflix’s money) to finally take the plunge and reproduce what many believe to be a near-sacred chapter of anime‘s history. For die-hard fans, and those who appreciate the overwhelming contribution Bebop has made to anime – and to how anime is perceived in the West – news of a live-action remake could be a cause of concern. However, there are glimmers of hope; Shinichiro Watanabe, Bebop’s original director has been brought on as a consultant on the project, which, if they listen to his guidance, will make the world of difference. His follow-ups of Samurai Champloo and Kids on the Slope are masterpieces, and Netflix getting him on the payroll is probably one of the most sensible aspects of this somewhat crazy project. However, the likes of set designers Shoji Kawamori and Isamu Imakake, and mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane from the original anime all, at present anyway, seem missing from this initial announcement. Yes, Mr Watanabe was the spark that made the Bebop and Swordfish fly, but without the geniuses who helped craft his world, the ships and vehicles and the tech on display – we could be left with a lifeless series dressed up scraps trying to cosplay as its elder brother.When anime live-action remakes are done badly, or merely half-baked, they’re excruciating to watch. Take, for instance, the Dragon Ball Z movie or the slow-motion car-crash that was M Night Shyamalan‘s The Last Airbender. But, despite the overwhelming evidence that live-action anime adaptations or remakes don’t work, there have been some diamonds in the rough, and Bebop may turn out to be one of them. Shusuke Kaneko’s Death Note movies were, unlike the Netflix adaptation, a fairly faithful re-tread of the original manga and anime. This year’s Bleach movie, adapted from Kubo Tite’s hugely successful Shonen Jump manga, landed surprisingly well with both fans and newcomers alike (you can even watch it on Netflix). And, Park Chan-wook‘s incredible Oldboy is a hammer to the face of anyone who says that live-action adaptations don’t work – Oldboy was, in fact, a crime manga from 1996. Another detail that could make or break this venture for Netflix is the music – an aspect that many argue is the lifeblood of Cowboy Bebop. The amazing soundtrack written by Yoko Kanno and performed by her band Seatbelts raised Bebop from an exceptional anime to the high pedestal that fans place it on 30 years later. As you can probably tell from the title, the music is integral to the lore and fabric of the entire series. You could even go so far to say that remaking Bebop with a new soundtrack wouldn’t work – the songs are as much a part of the characters a their names and story arc themselves. Many will breathe a sigh of relief if Netflix announced that they were simply going to re-use Yoko Kanno and Seatbelts recordings, but I fear we may have to endure a “re-imagined” version of the opening theme “Tank”.Personally, I feel no one really asked for a live action re-make. When speaking to someone about “where to start with anime” the first answer is almost always stream Bebop - it’s 26 sessions (episodes) of pure perfection and an excellent starting place for anyone in the gargantuan world of anime. Netflix was already golden in many fans’ eyes for simply licensing the sub and dub of the series and streaming it on their service – we no longer had to go hunting for the DVD box sets. Which raises the real question: who is this remake for? I doubt it’s for the fans, despite having no new Bebop since 2003 they’re not crying out for more. It’s not for people who have never seen the series, unless Netflix has managed to create some sort of mind reading machine they haven’t told us about. So, is this live-action remake simply be for people who don’t like watching anime or animated shows?

To say that this is a risky venture would be an understatement. As the first anime ever to be broadcast in the United States, thanks to Adult Swim, it’s considered by many in the West (myself included) as their gateway into the world of Japanese animation. Its unique characters, setting and storyline, sublime score and finite run time (one season and one movie) is something that simply doesn’t come along very often and I urge each and every one of you to watch it. But this news raises a very interesting question: why produce a live-action remake?Cowboy Bebop - TrailerA Bebop live-action movie has been gossiped about for years on internet fan forums and respectable news sites, with actors such as Keanu Reeves rumoured to play Spike Spiegel in a Western adaptation. But, as with many internet rumours, these never came to pass. Clearly, it took a giant like Netflix (and Netflix’s money) to finally take the plunge and reproduce what many believe to be a near-sacred chapter of anime‘s history. For die-hard fans, and those who appreciate the overwhelming contribution Bebop has made to anime – and to how anime is perceived in the West – news of a live-action remake could be a cause of concern. However, there are glimmers of hope; Shinichiro Watanabe, Bebop’s original director has been brought on as a consultant on the project, which, if they listen to his guidance, will make the world of difference. His follow-ups of Samurai Champloo and Kids on the Slope are masterpieces, and Netflix getting him on the payroll is probably one of the most sensible aspects of this somewhat crazy project. However, the likes of set designers Shoji Kawamori and Isamu Imakake, and mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane from the original anime all, at present anyway, seem missing from this initial announcement. Yes, Mr Watanabe was the spark that made the Bebop and Swordfish fly, but without the geniuses who helped craft his world, the ships and vehicles and the tech on display – we could be left with a lifeless series dressed up scraps trying to cosplay as its elder brother.When anime live-action remakes are done badly, or merely half-baked, they’re excruciating to watch. Take, for instance, the Dragon Ball Z movie or the slow-motion car-crash that was M Night Shyamalan‘s The Last Airbender. But, despite the overwhelming evidence that live-action anime adaptations or remakes don’t work, there have been some diamonds in the rough, and Bebop may turn out to be one of them. Shusuke Kaneko’s Death Note movies were, unlike the Netflix adaptation, a fairly faithful re-tread of the original manga and anime. This year’s Bleach movie, adapted from Kubo Tite’s hugely successful Shonen Jump manga, landed surprisingly well with both fans and newcomers alike (you can even watch it on Netflix). And, Park Chan-wook‘s incredible Oldboy is a hammer to the face of anyone who says that live-action adaptations don’t work – Oldboy was, in fact, a crime manga from 1996. Another detail that could make or break this venture for Netflix is the music – an aspect that many argue is the lifeblood of Cowboy Bebop. The amazing soundtrack written by Yoko Kanno and performed by her band Seatbelts raised Bebop from an exceptional anime to the high pedestal that fans place it on 30 years later. As you can probably tell from the title, the music is integral to the lore and fabric of the entire series. You could even go so far to say that remaking Bebop with a new soundtrack wouldn’t work – the songs are as much a part of the characters a their names and story arc themselves. Many will breathe a sigh of relief if Netflix announced that they were simply going to re-use Yoko Kanno and Seatbelts recordings, but I fear we may have to endure a “re-imagined” version of the opening theme “Tank”.Personally, I feel no one really asked for a live action re-make. When speaking to someone about “where to start with anime” the first answer is almost always stream Bebop - it’s 26 sessions (episodes) of pure perfection and an excellent starting place for anyone in the gargantuan world of anime. Netflix was already golden in many fans’ eyes for simply licensing the sub and dub of the series and streaming it on their service – we no longer had to go hunting for the DVD box sets. Which raises the real question: who is this remake for? I doubt it’s for the fans, despite having no new Bebop since 2003 they’re not crying out for more. It’s not for people who have never seen the series, unless Netflix has managed to create some sort of mind reading machine they haven’t told us about. So, is this live-action remake simply be for people who don’t like watching anime or animated shows? If that’s the case, who are these people, what do they have against animation and how can they ignore a plethora of interesting stories, settings and characters simply because of how they’re produced?Whatever happens, it seems thanks to Netflix we really will “see you space cowboy…”Sunrise / Netflix (Sunrise / Netflix) ",positive,en,{}

Paul Gosar shares bizarre anime video of him killing AOCThe House of Representatives on Wednesday will vote on a resolution to censure Republican congressman Paul Gosar for posting an animated video on social media that showed him killing New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and preparing to attack US president Joe Biden.Lawmakers are also likely to consider an amendment to remove Mr Gosar from the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee. He is part of the Oversight Committee along with Ms Ocasio-Cortez.The House Rules Committee on Tuesday voted 9-4 along party lines to advance the censure motion against the Arizona representative. Republicans Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois have reportedly extended their support for the resolution.Ten House Democrats, led by the co-chairs of the Democratic Women’s Caucus, announced last Wednesday that they will introduce a House resolution condemning Mr Gosar for tweeting the violent altered video. The Democrats in a statement said that Mr Gosar’s post “goes beyond the pale” and called it a “clear cut case for censure”.RecommendedTrump pours cold water on House speaker idea floated by Matt GaetzBargainers: Bipartisan deal near on trimmed $10B COVID billJared Kushner appears before Jan 6 committee - follow the latestA censure resolution is the highest form of punishment in the House. Once the resolution is approved by a majority of the House, the censured lawmaker is required to stand in the well of the House as the resolution of censure is read aloud by the House speaker. So far, the House has censured its members on 23 occasions.In the approximately 90-second-long altered clip from the opening credits of the anime Attack on Titan, animated characters whose faces had been replaced with Mr Gosar and fellow Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado are seen fighting other animated characters.The face of Ms Ocasio-Cortez is superimposed on a Titan that is killed by Mr Gosar’s character, who also attacks a character with Mr Biden’s face.The video – flagged by Twitter for violating the platform’s rules about hateful conduct – “was not meant to depict any harm or violence against anyone portrayed in the anime,” he said in a statement on 9 November. “This video is truly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy.”Although he took down the video following a backlash, he has not yet apologised. Earlier this week, he compared those criticising him for the anime video to the terrorists who killed 12 people at the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo. “For this cartoon, some in Congress suggest I should be punished in some fashion,” Mr Gosar said in a statement. “For a cartoon.” “While the degree of punishment differs, this is the same sentiment expressed against the Charlie Hebdo magazine in France in 2015 that was punished for publishing a cartoon – resulting in a real-life massacre of 12 real live people,” Mr Gosar added.In the wake of the incident, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said that threatening images like the one Mr Gosar tweeted meant that members like her had to raise more money for security. “It’s not just about me. This is that, if any member of Congress’ life is threatened, they have to fundraise for their own safety. I mean it’s ludicrous,” she said.She also criticised House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s unwillingness to properly admonish Mr Gosar. ""Rep McCarthy is not skittish, he is encouraging of this behaviour,” she told The Independent, adding that he encouraged the behaviour when then-representative Ted Yoho called her a “f***ing b****” last year.Mr McCarthy told reporters that Mr Gosar hadn’t seen it before it was posted. “It was not his intent to show any harm,” he said.RecommendedBargainers: Bipartisan deal near on trimmed $10B COVID billJared Kushner appears before Jan 6 committee - follow the latestBiden confirms massive oil reserves release amid Ukraine crisis - latestDemocratic Rep Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who had faced death threats, called for Mr Gosar to be punished. “He should be censured and expelled. Glorifying violence against your colleagues should not be ok and it should certainly not be ok in Congress,"" she said.Mr Gosar’s siblings – Jennifer, Dave, and Tim Gosar – wrote in The Independent last week that their brother is “ridiculously unfit” to be in congress and that he “needs to be stopped”.Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

The Democrats in a statement said that Mr Gosar’s post “goes beyond the pale” and called it a “clear cut case for censure”.RecommendedTrump pours cold water on House speaker idea floated by Matt GaetzBargainers: Bipartisan deal near on trimmed $10B COVID billJared Kushner appears before Jan 6 committee - follow the latestA censure resolution is the highest form of punishment in the House. Once the resolution is approved by a majority of the House, the censured lawmaker is required to stand in the well of the House as the resolution of censure is read aloud by the House speaker. So far, the House has censured its members on 23 occasions.In the approximately 90-second-long altered clip from the opening credits of the anime Attack on Titan, animated characters whose faces had been replaced with Mr Gosar and fellow Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado are seen fighting other animated characters.The face of Ms Ocasio-Cortez is superimposed on a Titan that is killed by Mr Gosar’s character, who also attacks a character with Mr Biden’s face.The video – flagged by Twitter for violating the platform’s rules about hateful conduct – “was not meant to depict any harm or violence against anyone portrayed in the anime,” he said in a statement on 9 November. “This video is truly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy.”Although he took down the video following a backlash, he has not yet apologised. Earlier this week, he compared those criticising him for the anime video to the terrorists who killed 12 people at the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo. “For this cartoon, some in Congress suggest I should be punished in some fashion,” Mr Gosar said in a statement. “For a cartoon.” “While the degree of punishment differs, this is the same sentiment expressed against the Charlie Hebdo magazine in France in 2015 that was punished for publishing a cartoon – resulting in a real-life massacre of 12 real live people,” Mr Gosar added.In the wake of the incident, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said that threatening images like the one Mr Gosar tweeted meant that members like her had to raise more money for security. “It’s not just about me.

The message has resonated in Japan as growing numbers of women call for change – most recently laid bare in a string of sexist comments by high-ranking Olympics officials that drew a fierce backlash.“I feel that women characters in Japanese anime are often depicted through a lens of desire leading to their sexual exploitation and too much is brushed off as a freedom of expression,” the film’s director, Mamoru Hosoda, says at his Studio Chizu, his animation studio in a Tokyo suburb.  But problematic female representation in anime, especially in television shows aimed at males, has been a concern for gender equality advocatesFrom Disney princesses to Marvel superheroes, from anime to pop music, creators across genres are rethinking how to portray women and girls with agency and dignity and show that beauty does not mean having to be “perfect”. Global movements such as #MeToo have also underscored a sense of common purpose.Hosoda said he hopes to draw attention to the ways that Japanese animation has shaped the public’s perceptions of women and girls and what it means to be beautiful and powerful.“Such exploitation [has been] … justified with the notion that it’s happening in a fantasy world and not in reality. But I feel that, surely, such perceptions are connected and will influence our reality,” he says at his office, decorated with posters and figurines.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upJapanese animation, which includes anime and manga, is among the country’s biggest cultural exports and has become popular on digital streaming. But problematic female representation in anime, especially in television shows aimed at males, has been a concern for gender equality advocates. Such depictions are both overt – exaggerated breasts and barely clothed girls – and subtle, such as storylines in which girls are damsels in distress and secondary to boys.In recent years, directors such as Hosoda have sought to challenge views in Japanese society that can devalue women, says Akiko Sugawa, a professor in gender and anime studies at Yokohama National University.“Anime has the power to create and break gender stereotypes,” she says. Anime director Mamoru Hosoda at his office in Tokyo  ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Sugawa says there is still much room for improvement, including the need for more women and LGBTQ anime directors. “There are now more positive portrayals of LGBTQ characters, issues and works that pose questions about societal problems. And with the rise of more diverse directors and anime decision-makers, there’s hope for more change to come,” Sugawa says. Belle is a modern twist on the Disney classic Beauty and the Beast. After her mother dies while trying to save a child from danger, Suzu struggles to fit in at school. She joins the virtual world “U” as Belle, a talented performer with eye-catching outfits who instantaneously gains billions of followers.With the computer savvy of her female best friend and the emotional support of her late mother’s female friends, Suzu/Belle embarks on an adventure to help a mysterious beast. Along the way, Belle performs several songs that can now be heard throughout shopping districts of Tokyo. Since its release in July, Belle has become Japan’s third-highest-grossing film this year.Hosoda seeks to give women and girls greater depth and humanity than is normally depicted in anime. Through Suzu/Belle, he juxtaposes the way that the inner beauty of Suzu and dynamism of Belle coexist in one person. For Suzu, an introverted teenager, her online persona is not just an imagination or an escape but rather a part of herself that she eventually grows into. Hosoda says he wanted to give Belle more complexity, in the way the character of Beast in the Disney film was afforded that depth. “Just like the beast having a duality, I wanted Belle to also have two sides and focus on how the two sides come to play, ultimately leading to her self-growth,” he says. Mamoru Hosoda draws at his Studio Chizu in Tokyo ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Hosoda received a 14-minute standing ovation when his film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in July. Belle has been replicated by “cosplayers”, who dress up as anime characters. The animated character Belle “performed” the film’s title song at the Fuji Rock Festival last month.On social media, Japanese fans have raved about the positive message, stunning visuals and catchy tunes. “Those who are feeling difficulty in their lives, those who want to change but can’t, I hope they see this film. It really helps you take a step forward,” one fan tweeted.Hosoda, 53, has long focused on the cyber world in his works, including the film versions of Digimon in1999 and 2000 and from his earliest feature films such as Summer Wars. He has depicted women and girls as independent and strong-willed characters, including the 2018 Mirai, a story about a boy who lashes out after his sister is born but learns the importance of family bonds.

The message has resonated in Japan as growing numbers of women call for change – most recently laid bare in a string of sexist comments by high-ranking Olympics officials that drew a fierce backlash.“I feel that women characters in Japanese anime are often depicted through a lens of desire leading to their sexual exploitation and too much is brushed off as a freedom of expression,” the film’s director, Mamoru Hosoda, says at his Studio Chizu, his animation studio in a Tokyo suburb.  But problematic female representation in anime, especially in television shows aimed at males, has been a concern for gender equality advocatesFrom Disney princesses to Marvel superheroes, from anime to pop music, creators across genres are rethinking how to portray women and girls with agency and dignity and show that beauty does not mean having to be “perfect”. Global movements such as #MeToo have also underscored a sense of common purpose.Hosoda said he hopes to draw attention to the ways that Japanese animation has shaped the public’s perceptions of women and girls and what it means to be beautiful and powerful.“Such exploitation [has been] … justified with the notion that it’s happening in a fantasy world and not in reality. But I feel that, surely, such perceptions are connected and will influence our reality,” he says at his office, decorated with posters and figurines.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upJapanese animation, which includes anime and manga, is among the country’s biggest cultural exports and has become popular on digital streaming. But problematic female representation in anime, especially in television shows aimed at males, has been a concern for gender equality advocates. Such depictions are both overt – exaggerated breasts and barely clothed girls – and subtle, such as storylines in which girls are damsels in distress and secondary to boys.In recent years, directors such as Hosoda have sought to challenge views in Japanese society that can devalue women, says Akiko Sugawa, a professor in gender and anime studies at Yokohama National University.“Anime has the power to create and break gender stereotypes,” she says. Anime director Mamoru Hosoda at his office in Tokyo  ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Sugawa says there is still much room for improvement, including the need for more women and LGBTQ anime directors. “There are now more positive portrayals of LGBTQ characters, issues and works that pose questions about societal problems. And with the rise of more diverse directors and anime decision-makers, there’s hope for more change to come,” Sugawa says. Belle is a modern twist on the Disney classic Beauty and the Beast. After her mother dies while trying to save a child from danger, Suzu struggles to fit in at school. She joins the virtual world “U” as Belle, a talented performer with eye-catching outfits who instantaneously gains billions of followers.With the computer savvy of her female best friend and the emotional support of her late mother’s female friends, Suzu/Belle embarks on an adventure to help a mysterious beast. Along the way, Belle performs several songs that can now be heard throughout shopping districts of Tokyo. Since its release in July, Belle has become Japan’s third-highest-grossing film this year.Hosoda seeks to give women and girls greater depth and humanity than is normally depicted in anime. Through Suzu/Belle, he juxtaposes the way that the inner beauty of Suzu and dynamism of Belle coexist in one person. For Suzu, an introverted teenager, her online persona is not just an imagination or an escape but rather a part of herself that she eventually grows into. Hosoda says he wanted to give Belle more complexity, in the way the character of Beast in the Disney film was afforded that depth. “Just like the beast having a duality, I wanted Belle to also have two sides and focus on how the two sides come to play, ultimately leading to her self-growth,” he says. Mamoru Hosoda draws at his Studio Chizu in Tokyo ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Hosoda received a 14-minute standing ovation when his film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in July. Belle has been replicated by “cosplayers”, who dress up as anime characters. The animated character Belle “performed” the film’s title song at the Fuji Rock Festival last month.On social media, Japanese fans have raved about the positive message, stunning visuals and catchy tunes. “Those who are feeling difficulty in their lives, those who want to change but can’t, I hope they see this film. It really helps you take a step forward,” one fan tweeted.Hosoda, 53, has long focused on the cyber world in his works, including the film versions of Digimon in1999 and 2000 and from his earliest feature films such as Summer Wars. He has depicted women and girls as independent and strong-willed characters, including the 2018 Mirai, a story about a boy who lashes out after his sister is born but learns the importance of family bonds. The film earned Hosoda an Oscar nomination for best animated feature film.But through Belle, Hosoda has delivered perhaps his most explicit message about female empowerment and the power of technology as a force for good.

Anime director Mamoru Hosoda at his office in Tokyo  ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Sugawa says there is still much room for improvement, including the need for more women and LGBTQ anime directors. “There are now more positive portrayals of LGBTQ characters, issues and works that pose questions about societal problems. And with the rise of more diverse directors and anime decision-makers, there’s hope for more change to come,” Sugawa says. Belle is a modern twist on the Disney classic Beauty and the Beast. After her mother dies while trying to save a child from danger, Suzu struggles to fit in at school. She joins the virtual world “U” as Belle, a talented performer with eye-catching outfits who instantaneously gains billions of followers.With the computer savvy of her female best friend and the emotional support of her late mother’s female friends, Suzu/Belle embarks on an adventure to help a mysterious beast. Along the way, Belle performs several songs that can now be heard throughout shopping districts of Tokyo. Since its release in July, Belle has become Japan’s third-highest-grossing film this year.Hosoda seeks to give women and girls greater depth and humanity than is normally depicted in anime. Through Suzu/Belle, he juxtaposes the way that the inner beauty of Suzu and dynamism of Belle coexist in one person. For Suzu, an introverted teenager, her online persona is not just an imagination or an escape but rather a part of herself that she eventually grows into. Hosoda says he wanted to give Belle more complexity, in the way the character of Beast in the Disney film was afforded that depth. “Just like the beast having a duality, I wanted Belle to also have two sides and focus on how the two sides come to play, ultimately leading to her self-growth,” he says. Mamoru Hosoda draws at his Studio Chizu in Tokyo ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Hosoda received a 14-minute standing ovation when his film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in July. Belle has been replicated by “cosplayers”, who dress up as anime characters. The animated character Belle “performed” the film’s title song at the Fuji Rock Festival last month.On social media, Japanese fans have raved about the positive message, stunning visuals and catchy tunes. “Those who are feeling difficulty in their lives, those who want to change but can’t, I hope they see this film. It really helps you take a step forward,” one fan tweeted.Hosoda, 53, has long focused on the cyber world in his works, including the film versions of Digimon in1999 and 2000 and from his earliest feature films such as Summer Wars. He has depicted women and girls as independent and strong-willed characters, including the 2018 Mirai, a story about a boy who lashes out after his sister is born but learns the importance of family bonds. The film earned Hosoda an Oscar nomination for best animated feature film.But through Belle, Hosoda has delivered perhaps his most explicit message about female empowerment and the power of technology as a force for good. He says he was inspired by his five-year-old daughter, as he contemplates the future she faces. “She is still in preschool and is quite introverted, so I imagined how she was going to survive once she gets on social media and begins having all sorts of online interactions,” he says.

But it isn’t just Netflix that’s failing to appreciate what makes the format so distinct, writes Louis ChiltonMonday 22 November 2021 10:56Comments                  Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon't show me this message again✕        Alex Hassell as Vicious and John Cho as Spike Spiegel in Netflix’s ‘Cowboy Bebop' (Geoffrey Short/Netflix)Animation is a realm of boundless possibility. It is a mode of storytelling where no idea need go unexpressed, where no image is too fanciful to bring to life. When it comes to pushing the boundaries of animation, there aren’t too many better examples than Cowboy Bebop, the 1990s Japanese anime series about a band of interstellar bounty hunters. It’s often cited as an anime for people who otherwise wouldn’t touch it – a gateway drug to the form, compared to the tar heroin of something like Paranoia Agent or Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. It is one of the finest examples of episodic animation to have ever been made.Despite this, or because of it, Cowboy Bebop has now been adapted into a live-action English-language series, arriving today on Netflix. Starring John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, the remake has been met with excitement from fans of the original, but no small amount of trepidation. Though the series is painstakingly faithful to the anime in many regards – recreating its immediately recognisable opening credits beat for beat, for instance – early footage of the show also faced criticism for lacking the original’s visual elan. When the first reviews came in, they were roundly damning. But the problem with Bebop goes deeper than just a few drably lit backgrounds. It speaks to something fundamentally lacking in how anime is understood and valued in the west.There are many errant stereotypes about anime. That it’s for children. It’s too weird. It’s for nerds. It’s off-putting in its approach to sexuality. There are reasons for this, of course. Many of the most widely recognisable animes among western audiences have been made for children, such as Pokemon, Digimon and Dragon Ball Z. Some anime series and films are regressive or bizarre in their sexual politics, though not all. As for whether it’s for nerds? “Nerd culture” is just an epithet ascribed to material that exists outside the mainstream but lacks highbrow critical esteem. In recent years, the old signifiers of nerddom – superhero fiction, sci-fi films, video games – have been subsumed into the very heart of western mainstream culture. The conventional “nerd” stigma was then affixed to other, more niche pursuits, anime being one such. But anime can hardly be called a niche fascination any more, even in the west. The anime film Demon Slayer topped the global box office last year (admittedly in a year stunted by Covid), taking in more than half a billion dollars worldwide. Nearly $50m came from US cinemas; the UK contributed more than £1m in ticket sales (hardly a sensation – but not nothing, either).Bebop is not the only poorly received remake of an acclaimed anime to blight our screens in recent years. Ghost in the Shell took a seminal anime feature and bastardised it, controversially casting white American star Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. Western remakes of the seminal dystopian anime Akira and 2016’s hit body-switch romance Your Name are both supposedly in the works, with Taika Waititi somewhat ambiguously attached to make the former. There is, quite frankly, no reason for any of these projects to exist. Re-making them in live action is a transparent attempt to cash in on their greatness by repackaging it in a more widely marketable format, one that is sure to lose everything special and distinct about the originals. It’s telling that perhaps the best-known anime creator in the world, Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki, has turned down a litany of adaptation offers for his films.Of course, the ill-fated live-action remake is not unique to anime. Disney are gradually ploughing through their catalogue of animated classics, re-imagining them as insipid CGI-laden remakes. The anime-inspired American series Avatar: The Last Airbender was adapted once, wretchedly, by M Night Shyamalan, with another Netflix live-action adaptation forthcoming. Though the stigma lessens with every generation that grows up in a post-Simpsons landscape, western animation still contends with many of the same inane prejudices as anime – that it is juvenile, that it is somehow less substantial than live-action fare.

But it isn’t just Netflix that’s failing to appreciate what makes the format so distinct, writes Louis ChiltonMonday 22 November 2021 10:56Comments                  Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon't show me this message again✕        Alex Hassell as Vicious and John Cho as Spike Spiegel in Netflix’s ‘Cowboy Bebop' (Geoffrey Short/Netflix)Animation is a realm of boundless possibility. It is a mode of storytelling where no idea need go unexpressed, where no image is too fanciful to bring to life. When it comes to pushing the boundaries of animation, there aren’t too many better examples than Cowboy Bebop, the 1990s Japanese anime series about a band of interstellar bounty hunters. It’s often cited as an anime for people who otherwise wouldn’t touch it – a gateway drug to the form, compared to the tar heroin of something like Paranoia Agent or Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. It is one of the finest examples of episodic animation to have ever been made.Despite this, or because of it, Cowboy Bebop has now been adapted into a live-action English-language series, arriving today on Netflix. Starring John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, the remake has been met with excitement from fans of the original, but no small amount of trepidation. Though the series is painstakingly faithful to the anime in many regards – recreating its immediately recognisable opening credits beat for beat, for instance – early footage of the show also faced criticism for lacking the original’s visual elan. When the first reviews came in, they were roundly damning. But the problem with Bebop goes deeper than just a few drably lit backgrounds. It speaks to something fundamentally lacking in how anime is understood and valued in the west.There are many errant stereotypes about anime. That it’s for children. It’s too weird. It’s for nerds. It’s off-putting in its approach to sexuality. There are reasons for this, of course. Many of the most widely recognisable animes among western audiences have been made for children, such as Pokemon, Digimon and Dragon Ball Z. Some anime series and films are regressive or bizarre in their sexual politics, though not all. As for whether it’s for nerds? “Nerd culture” is just an epithet ascribed to material that exists outside the mainstream but lacks highbrow critical esteem. In recent years, the old signifiers of nerddom – superhero fiction, sci-fi films, video games – have been subsumed into the very heart of western mainstream culture. The conventional “nerd” stigma was then affixed to other, more niche pursuits, anime being one such. But anime can hardly be called a niche fascination any more, even in the west. The anime film Demon Slayer topped the global box office last year (admittedly in a year stunted by Covid), taking in more than half a billion dollars worldwide. Nearly $50m came from US cinemas; the UK contributed more than £1m in ticket sales (hardly a sensation – but not nothing, either).Bebop is not the only poorly received remake of an acclaimed anime to blight our screens in recent years. Ghost in the Shell took a seminal anime feature and bastardised it, controversially casting white American star Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. Western remakes of the seminal dystopian anime Akira and 2016’s hit body-switch romance Your Name are both supposedly in the works, with Taika Waititi somewhat ambiguously attached to make the former. There is, quite frankly, no reason for any of these projects to exist. Re-making them in live action is a transparent attempt to cash in on their greatness by repackaging it in a more widely marketable format, one that is sure to lose everything special and distinct about the originals. It’s telling that perhaps the best-known anime creator in the world, Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki, has turned down a litany of adaptation offers for his films.Of course, the ill-fated live-action remake is not unique to anime. Disney are gradually ploughing through their catalogue of animated classics, re-imagining them as insipid CGI-laden remakes. The anime-inspired American series Avatar: The Last Airbender was adapted once, wretchedly, by M Night Shyamalan, with another Netflix live-action adaptation forthcoming. Though the stigma lessens with every generation that grows up in a post-Simpsons landscape, western animation still contends with many of the same inane prejudices as anime – that it is juvenile, that it is somehow less substantial than live-action fare. It’s just that anime faces the additional cultural barrier of being “foreign”, something that has always inhibited mainstream western audiences from enjoying some of film and TV’s very best.RecommendedJeff Bezos, The Wheel of Time and the futility of throwing cash at the tellySopranos’ Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa: ‘James Gandolfini never felt comfortable being the centre of attention’Gemma Whelan: ‘Pregnant women are not ill’I’m sure Cowboy Bebop’s defenders will point out that, at the very least, the new series will steer viewers towards the original (also available on Netflix).

It is a mode of storytelling where no idea need go unexpressed, where no image is too fanciful to bring to life. When it comes to pushing the boundaries of animation, there aren’t too many better examples than Cowboy Bebop, the 1990s Japanese anime series about a band of interstellar bounty hunters. It’s often cited as an anime for people who otherwise wouldn’t touch it – a gateway drug to the form, compared to the tar heroin of something like Paranoia Agent or Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. It is one of the finest examples of episodic animation to have ever been made.Despite this, or because of it, Cowboy Bebop has now been adapted into a live-action English-language series, arriving today on Netflix. Starring John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, the remake has been met with excitement from fans of the original, but no small amount of trepidation. Though the series is painstakingly faithful to the anime in many regards – recreating its immediately recognisable opening credits beat for beat, for instance – early footage of the show also faced criticism for lacking the original’s visual elan. When the first reviews came in, they were roundly damning. But the problem with Bebop goes deeper than just a few drably lit backgrounds. It speaks to something fundamentally lacking in how anime is understood and valued in the west.There are many errant stereotypes about anime. That it’s for children. It’s too weird. It’s for nerds. It’s off-putting in its approach to sexuality. There are reasons for this, of course. Many of the most widely recognisable animes among western audiences have been made for children, such as Pokemon, Digimon and Dragon Ball Z. Some anime series and films are regressive or bizarre in their sexual politics, though not all. As for whether it’s for nerds? “Nerd culture” is just an epithet ascribed to material that exists outside the mainstream but lacks highbrow critical esteem. In recent years, the old signifiers of nerddom – superhero fiction, sci-fi films, video games – have been subsumed into the very heart of western mainstream culture. The conventional “nerd” stigma was then affixed to other, more niche pursuits, anime being one such. But anime can hardly be called a niche fascination any more, even in the west. The anime film Demon Slayer topped the global box office last year (admittedly in a year stunted by Covid), taking in more than half a billion dollars worldwide. Nearly $50m came from US cinemas; the UK contributed more than £1m in ticket sales (hardly a sensation – but not nothing, either).Bebop is not the only poorly received remake of an acclaimed anime to blight our screens in recent years. Ghost in the Shell took a seminal anime feature and bastardised it, controversially casting white American star Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. Western remakes of the seminal dystopian anime Akira and 2016’s hit body-switch romance Your Name are both supposedly in the works, with Taika Waititi somewhat ambiguously attached to make the former. There is, quite frankly, no reason for any of these projects to exist. Re-making them in live action is a transparent attempt to cash in on their greatness by repackaging it in a more widely marketable format, one that is sure to lose everything special and distinct about the originals. It’s telling that perhaps the best-known anime creator in the world, Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki, has turned down a litany of adaptation offers for his films.Of course, the ill-fated live-action remake is not unique to anime. Disney are gradually ploughing through their catalogue of animated classics, re-imagining them as insipid CGI-laden remakes. The anime-inspired American series Avatar: The Last Airbender was adapted once, wretchedly, by M Night Shyamalan, with another Netflix live-action adaptation forthcoming. Though the stigma lessens with every generation that grows up in a post-Simpsons landscape, western animation still contends with many of the same inane prejudices as anime – that it is juvenile, that it is somehow less substantial than live-action fare. It’s just that anime faces the additional cultural barrier of being “foreign”, something that has always inhibited mainstream western audiences from enjoying some of film and TV’s very best.RecommendedJeff Bezos, The Wheel of Time and the futility of throwing cash at the tellySopranos’ Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa: ‘James Gandolfini never felt comfortable being the centre of attention’Gemma Whelan: ‘Pregnant women are not ill’I’m sure Cowboy Bebop’s defenders will point out that, at the very least, the new series will steer viewers towards the original (also available on Netflix). But that’s an awfully elaborate way to advertise a two-decade-old TV show. And it was doing just fine by itself, anyway. Cowboy Bebop was never meant to be source material for some glossier, more marketable re-hash.

I don't envy the character designer's job, trying to simplify the character designs for animation.   Plus: elaborate backgrounds.   Gosh, their clothes alone!

I've been trying to read this for ages, but for all the great things I've read about the manga it could just never keep my attention - not the manga's fault, btw, it's probably all on me.

Witch Hat is similar to Berserk in that part of what makes it special is that art style and detail in everything. Anime inherently simplifies things so as to not kill its animators, so I worry that part of that magic will be lost when it inevitably gets streamlined. Some of the background detail could certainly be augmented with the improved CG of the day, but we've all seen CG done poorly and if its used on the characters it could Destroy the show.    All in all I'm like, 60% excited 40% nervous and will remain that way until we get more information about who's actually doing this.

It feels like there will eventually be big, exciting revelations about the world and the characters, but that they're years and years away, which I think can make it somewhat less of a must-read than the lavish artwork would indicate.

It's usually about the art or world building.

I don't envy the character designer's job, trying to simplify the character designs for animation.   Plus: elaborate backgrounds.   Gosh, their clothes alone!

I've been trying to read this for ages, but for all the great things I've read about the manga it could just never keep my attention - not the manga's fault, btw, it's probably all on me.

Witch Hat is similar to Berserk in that part of what makes it special is that art style and detail in everything. Anime inherently simplifies things so as to not kill its animators, so I worry that part of that magic will be lost when it inevitably gets streamlined. Some of the background detail could certainly be augmented with the improved CG of the day, but we've all seen CG done poorly and if its used on the characters it could Destroy the show.    All in all I'm like, 60% excited 40% nervous and will remain that way until we get more information about who's actually doing this.

It feels like there will eventually be big, exciting revelations about the world and the characters, but that they're years and years away, which I think can make it somewhat less of a must-read than the lavish artwork would indicate.

It's usually about the art or world building.

Witch Hat is similar to Berserk in that part of what makes it special is that art style and detail in everything. Anime inherently simplifies things so as to not kill its animators, so I worry that part of that magic will be lost when it inevitably gets streamlined. Some of the background detail could certainly be augmented with the improved CG of the day, but we've all seen CG done poorly and if its used on the characters it could Destroy the show.

Witch Hat is similar to Berserk in that part of what makes it special is that art style and detail in everything. Anime inherently simplifies things so as to not kill its animators, so I worry that part of that magic will be lost when it inevitably gets streamlined. Some of the background detail could certainly be augmented with the improved CG of the day, but we've all seen CG done poorly and if its used on the characters it could Destroy the show.

I've been trying to read this for ages, but for all the great things I've read about the manga it could just never keep my attention - not the manga's fault, btw, it's probably all on me.

Witch Hat is similar to Berserk in that part of what makes it special is that art style and detail in everything. Anime inherently simplifies things so as to not kill its animators, so I worry that part of that magic will be lost when it inevitably gets streamlined. Some of the background detail could certainly be augmented with the improved CG of the day, but we've all seen CG done poorly and if its used on the characters it could Destroy the show.    All in all I'm like, 60% excited 40% nervous and will remain that way until we get more information about who's actually doing this.

It feels like there will eventually be big, exciting revelations about the world and the characters, but that they're years and years away, which I think can make it somewhat less of a must-read than the lavish artwork would indicate.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.

Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.

In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover.
