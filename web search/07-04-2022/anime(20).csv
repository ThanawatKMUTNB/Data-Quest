News Chainsaw Man's Tatsuki Fujimoto to Release New 200-Page 1-Shot on April 11   posted on 2022-04-04 13:28 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Shueisha to release entire 1-shot on Shonen Jump+     Shihei Lin, an editor for works such as SPY x FAMILY and Chainsaw Man, announced on Twitter on Monday that Chainsaw Man manga creator Tatsuki Fujimoto will release a new 200-page one-shot manga digitally on April 11. Shueisha will publish the manga on its Shonen Jump+ app and website.    Fujimoto published a 140-page one-shot manga titled Look Back on Shonen Jump+ in July 2021. Shueisha's MANGA Plus service and Viz Media both published the manga in English digitally. The manga topped the Kono Manga ga Sugoi! 2022 list for male readers, and was nominated for the 14th Manga Taisho awards.    Fujimoto (Fire Punch) debuted the Chainsaw Man manga in Weekly Shonen Jump in December 2018 and ended its ""first part,"" the ""Kōan"" (Public Safety) arc, in December 2020. The manga will return with its second part titled ""Gakkō-hen"" (School Arc) on Shonen Jump+ this summer.    The manga was nominated for the 13th Manga Taisho awards in 2019, and ranked at #4 on the Kono Manga ga Sugoi! 2020 (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook's top manga for male readers. The manga won in the Best Shōnen Manga category at the 66th Shogakukan Manga Awards in January 2021. Additionally, the manga topped the Kono Manga ga Sugoi! 2021 list for male readers. The manga won the Best Manga award at The Harvey Awards last October.    Viz Media is publishing the manga simultaneously digitally, and is also publishing the manga in print.

So when  see this looks visually awful, that's saying something.    Even by low standards of cheaply made licensed Anime games, this is terrible. At 0:35 it actually looks like an N64 game in HD, not even joking it has the same 3D models you could find in a video game of that era. As for the character models, well I played a One Piece game on the Wii that had better character models than this.

I might still end up getting it just because MiA is my favorite anime so I will probably feel the need to at least give this a fair chance but it honestly looks pretty low effort and rough in every way.

None Mainstream anime games never get dubbed. Let alone a Sentai Dub.    I'll probably get it on PS4. The last time I had to choose Switch or PS4 for a game, the Switch version had frame rate errors, and bad load times.

There's a reason people like when they make stuff like 428,Zero Escape games,the Daganronpa games and AI The Somnium Files,but roll their eyes when they make fighting games like Jump Force,that One Punch Man game,One Piece burning Blood and etc.      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

I mean, this would barely be acceptable from indie devs in the west, weebs deserve better.

So when  see this looks visually awful, that's saying something.    Even by low standards of cheaply made licensed Anime games, this is terrible. At 0:35 it actually looks like an N64 game in HD, not even joking it has the same 3D models you could find in a video game of that era. As for the character models, well I played a One Piece game on the Wii that had better character models than this.

There's a reason people like when they make stuff like 428,Zero Escape games,the Daganronpa games and AI The Somnium Files,but roll their eyes when they make fighting games like Jump Force,that One Punch Man game,One Piece burning Blood and etc.      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group   ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

No spoilers shall be forthcoming from me, but I was very happy that the film's interviewers addressed the only part of the story that didn't make sense to me by asking Shirakawa how she knew to be in a deserted construction site to capoeira Odokawa out of certain strangulation by Yamamoto.

Lol         Not having listened to the audio dramas, I had no idea that was even a thing! Now that you ask, yes, the credits montage does address the fates of basically the entire cast, including Odokawa's and Taeko's... to an extent. It's still Odd Taxi; there is room for interpretation in everything, but all the answers are (probably) there.

No spoilers shall be forthcoming from me, but I was very happy that the film's interviewers addressed the only part of the story that didn't make sense to me by asking Shirakawa how she knew to be in a deserted construction site to capoeira Odokawa out of certain strangulation by Yamamoto.

Lol         Not having listened to the audio dramas, I had no idea that was even a thing! Now that you ask, yes, the credits montage does address the fates of basically the entire cast, including Odokawa's and Taeko's... to an extent. It's still Odd Taxi; there is room for interpretation in everything, but all the answers are (probably) there.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.
