It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling. Sometimes, events may flow naturally from one chapter to the next. Other times, we get a chapter that is unrelated to any overarching narrative.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

Interest Golgo 13 Teaches Travel Safety Protocols In Government-Sponsored Manual, Videos   posted on 2022-04-05 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         The eponymous hitman takes down terrorists attempting to take advantage of laxed counterterrorism measures under COVID-19    Since 2017, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has been issuing manuals to promote travel safety using Takao Saito's Golgo 13 manga. MOFA updated the manual in 2021 to include information about preventing the spread of COVID-19. Last Friday, the government agency unveiled an ""extra story"" based on the manual featuring animated manga panels.      The plot follows the eponymous hitman as he takes down terrorists attempting to take advantage of laxed counterterrorism measures under COVID-19. MOFA describes it as ""a story that conveys the necessity of dealing with the combined risks of infection and terrorism."" Hiroshi Tachi reprises his voice role as Duke ""Golgo 13"" Tōgō.    MOFA issued the original manual as a response to the July 2016 terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which killed seven Japanese nationals. The manual is available on MOFA's website in video and PDF formats.

Interest Golgo 13 Teaches Travel Safety Protocols In Government-Sponsored Manual, Videos   posted on 2022-04-05 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         The eponymous hitman takes down terrorists attempting to take advantage of laxed counterterrorism measures under COVID-19    Since 2017, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has been issuing manuals to promote travel safety using Takao Saito's Golgo 13 manga. MOFA updated the manual in 2021 to include information about preventing the spread of COVID-19. Last Friday, the government agency unveiled an ""extra story"" based on the manual featuring animated manga panels.      The plot follows the eponymous hitman as he takes down terrorists attempting to take advantage of laxed counterterrorism measures under COVID-19. MOFA describes it as ""a story that conveys the necessity of dealing with the combined risks of infection and terrorism."" Hiroshi Tachi reprises his voice role as Duke ""Golgo 13"" Tōgō.    MOFA issued the original manual as a response to the July 2016 terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which killed seven Japanese nationals. The manual is available on MOFA's website in video and PDF formats.

Said DMR's Director of Digital Distribution and Content Strategy John Stack, “Our relationship with The Roku Channel in the U.S. and Canada has been mutually-beneficial since it began nearly two years ago, and we're pleased to find new opportunities to utilize what each company does best.  We believe The Roku Channel users will enjoy viewing the wide variety of Asian entertainment that AsianCrush consistently delivers, and are delighted to be expanding the reach of this popular, premium content.”  DMR previously launched AsianCrush, RetroCrush and Midnight Pulp on The Roku Channel in Canada last December with the premieres of the three DMR streaming channels marking the company's linear entry into the Canadian marketplace.

News Made in Abyss 3D Action RPG Launches in English This Fall   posted on 2022-04-05 23:21 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness launches for PS4, Switch, Steam     Spike Chunsoft began streaming an announcement video on Monday for Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness (Made in Abyss: Yami o Mezashita Rensei), its new 3D action RPG for the Made in Abyss franchise. The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in fall 2022.      The game will have an original story supervised by Akihito Tsukushi and will be available in both English and Japanese (with  fully voiced event scenes). Numskull Games is publishing the physical version in Europe.    Spike Chunsoft describes the story:  The story begins with Riko and Reg's meeting in the first episode of season one. This marks the start of their great adventure, and together they travel to Seeker Camp in the second layer of the Abyss. Experience the awesome power of the Curse of the Abyss, as well as the astonishing, legendary entities known as primeval creatures. Prepare to glimpse the world of Riko and her friends.  The game will also feature a ""story mode"" that follows the storyline of the anime adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga. The physical version of the game will also be available in a Collector's Edition that will include merchandise from the franchise.    Akihito Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Takeshobo published the 10th compiled book volume in July 2021. Seven Seas published the ninth volume in English in March 2020 and will ship the 10th volume on May 3.    The second season of the television anime will premiere in July.    The first 13-episode television anime series based on the manga premiered in Japan in July 2017.  The English-subtitled version of the show streamed in the United States on Amazon's Anime Strike service, and HIDIVE streamed the series outside of the United States.     The first compilation film for the anime, Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn (Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake), opened in Japan in January 2019, followed by the second film, Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight (Made in Abyss: Hōrō Suru Tasogare), two weeks later. Sentai Filmworks premiered the first film in Los Angeles in March 2019, before it opened in theaters later that month. Sentai Filmworks premiered the second film in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2019, before it opened in theaters in the United States later that month.     Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul, a sequel film to the first season, opened in Japan in January 2020.  Sentai Filmworks premiered the movie in select theaters in the U.S. and Canada in August 2020. Sentai Filmworks again screened the film virtually in September 2020, and HIDIVE will begin streaming the film on June 28.    Sony's Columbia Pictures has ordered a feature film script of the manga from writer and director Kevin McMullin. Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment and Mobius Productions' Masi Oka (Heroes' Hiro Nakamura actor, Outer Wilds game) are producing the project, after previously collaborating on the 2017 Death Note film (as well as its planned sequel) and the live-action The Promised Neverland series in development at Amazon.

News Made in Abyss 3D Action RPG Launches in English This Fall   posted on 2022-04-05 23:21 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness launches for PS4, Switch, Steam     Spike Chunsoft began streaming an announcement video on Monday for Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness (Made in Abyss: Yami o Mezashita Rensei), its new 3D action RPG for the Made in Abyss franchise. The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in fall 2022.      The game will have an original story supervised by Akihito Tsukushi and will be available in both English and Japanese (with  fully voiced event scenes). Numskull Games is publishing the physical version in Europe.    Spike Chunsoft describes the story:  The story begins with Riko and Reg's meeting in the first episode of season one. This marks the start of their great adventure, and together they travel to Seeker Camp in the second layer of the Abyss. Experience the awesome power of the Curse of the Abyss, as well as the astonishing, legendary entities known as primeval creatures. Prepare to glimpse the world of Riko and her friends.  The game will also feature a ""story mode"" that follows the storyline of the anime adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga. The physical version of the game will also be available in a Collector's Edition that will include merchandise from the franchise.    Akihito Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Takeshobo published the 10th compiled book volume in July 2021. Seven Seas published the ninth volume in English in March 2020 and will ship the 10th volume on May 3.    The second season of the television anime will premiere in July.    The first 13-episode television anime series based on the manga premiered in Japan in July 2017.  The English-subtitled version of the show streamed in the United States on Amazon's Anime Strike service, and HIDIVE streamed the series outside of the United States.     The first compilation film for the anime, Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn (Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake), opened in Japan in January 2019, followed by the second film, Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight (Made in Abyss: Hōrō Suru Tasogare), two weeks later. Sentai Filmworks premiered the first film in Los Angeles in March 2019, before it opened in theaters later that month. Sentai Filmworks premiered the second film in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2019, before it opened in theaters in the United States later that month.     Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul, a sequel film to the first season, opened in Japan in January 2020.  Sentai Filmworks premiered the movie in select theaters in the U.S. and Canada in August 2020. Sentai Filmworks again screened the film virtually in September 2020, and HIDIVE will begin streaming the film on June 28.    Sony's Columbia Pictures has ordered a feature film script of the manga from writer and director Kevin McMullin. Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment and Mobius Productions' Masi Oka (Heroes' Hiro Nakamura actor, Outer Wilds game) are producing the project, after previously collaborating on the 2017 Death Note film (as well as its planned sequel) and the live-action The Promised Neverland series in development at Amazon.
