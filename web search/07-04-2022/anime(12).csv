World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself.

Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I too was morbidly curious how the story continued because I don't think the anime adapted very far into the LN, but I also found the MC so insufferable by the end that I'm not sure if I want to see how it continues.

It had some genuinely nice moments (Kawasegawa's airport speech was my favorite), but was rushed and relied too much on telling vs. showing.   Interested to see if it will get a 2nd season now that the source material has wrapped.

The subsequent episodes were great, but the last couple were rushed and the conclusion, as mentioned, was unsatisfying.  I think an S2 would help.

I too was morbidly curious how the story continued because I don't think the anime adapted very far into the LN, but I also found the MC so insufferable by the end that I'm not sure if I want to see how it continues.

It had some genuinely nice moments (Kawasegawa's airport speech was my favorite), but was rushed and relied too much on telling vs. showing.   Interested to see if it will get a 2nd season now that the source material has wrapped.

The subsequent episodes were great, but the last couple were rushed and the conclusion, as mentioned, was unsatisfying.  I think an S2 would help.

News Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia  Game Gets Steam Release on May 11   posted on 2022-04-05 09:00 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Game released on Switch, PS4 in 2020    Happinet announced on Monday that it and Matrix Software's Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia game will release worldwide for Steam on May 11. The new version includes a ""Creative Mode"" that unlocks after completing the game's Main Mode.

The game launched digitally for the Switch in June 2020, and then launched for PlayStation 4 in December 2020.    Happinet describes the game:    In Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia, six countries in the Continent of Runersia have waged a war to conquer and unify the land under one nation. Players decide how their legend will unfold by selecting a country and creating their army of Rune Knights, exploring over 40 base locations and encountering over 100 unique knights and 50 types of monsters as they progress across Runersia. The original Brigandine turn-based strategy game debuted for the PlayStation in 1998. Hearty Robin developed the game. Atlus published the game in the United States. The game's Brigandine: Grand Edition remake debuted in 2000 but was never released in English.   In the game, players select one of six nations and control their rune knight heroes and various monsters in turn-based battles to control the entire continent. The Grand Edition remake of the game added a multiplayer feature.

News Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia  Game Gets Steam Release on May 11   posted on 2022-04-05 09:00 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Game released on Switch, PS4 in 2020    Happinet announced on Monday that it and Matrix Software's Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia game will release worldwide for Steam on May 11. The new version includes a ""Creative Mode"" that unlocks after completing the game's Main Mode. In Creative Mode, players ""can pick their preferred power balance and starting knights and play at leisure without a time limit.""      The game launched digitally for the Switch in June 2020, and then launched for PlayStation 4 in December 2020.    Happinet describes the game:    In Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia, six countries in the Continent of Runersia have waged a war to conquer and unify the land under one nation. Players decide how their legend will unfold by selecting a country and creating their army of Rune Knights, exploring over 40 base locations and encountering over 100 unique knights and 50 types of monsters as they progress across Runersia. The original Brigandine turn-based strategy game debuted for the PlayStation in 1998. Hearty Robin developed the game. Atlus published the game in the United States. The game's Brigandine: Grand Edition remake debuted in 2000 but was never released in English.   In the game, players select one of six nations and control their rune knight heroes and various monsters in turn-based battles to control the entire continent. The Grand Edition remake of the game added a multiplayer feature.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (147 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (147 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (147 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (147 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey.

It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (147 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old.

Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (147 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.

And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.  ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film Debuts at #10, Live-Action Mr. Osomatsu Stays at #2   posted on 2022-04-05 14:11 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Doraemon film stays at #3, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 drops to #7    The live-action film of the Mr. Osomatsu (Osomatsu-san) franchise stayed at #2 in its second weekend. The film sold 144,000 tickets on Saturday and Sunday, earning 213 million yen (approximately US$1.73 million). The movie has sold a total of 750,000 tickets and earned a total of 1.0 billion yen (approximately US$8.14 million).    The film opened on March 25.    In the film's story, a rich man appears, proclaiming that he will adopt one of the sextuplets. Just as the six engage in a battle royale to be the rich man's heir, three mysterious ""story-ending"" figures take on the brothers in a battle to the finish.    Tsutomu Hanabusa (Kakegurui, Tokyo Revengers live-action films) directed the film. Ryōichi Tsuchiya wrote the screenplay, and Daiki Sugawara was a producer. Cinebazar and Hachinoji produced the film for TOHO to distribute.   The Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 anime film stayed at #3 in its fifth weekend. The film sold 120,000 tickets on Saturday and Sunday to earn 149 million yen (approximately US$1.21 million). The film has sold a total of 1.78 million tickets and has earned 2.1 billion yen (approximately US$17.1 million).    The film opened at #1, and sold 350,000 tickets for 440 million yen (about US$3.81 million) in its first three days. The film opened on March 4 after a yearlong delay due to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 is the 41st film in the Doraemon franchise. The film is a remake of the 1985 Doraemon film of the same title. Susumu Yamaguchi — a key animator on many previous Doraemon movies, unit director of Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration, and the director of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE — directed the new film. Dai Sato (Eureka Seven, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Listeners) penned the script. Official HiGE DANdism created the theme song ""Universe"" specifically for the film. Sibling folk duo Billy BanBan performed the insert song ""Kokoro Arigatō"" (Thank You for the Heart). Shirogumi, the 3D CG studio behind the production of the Stand By Me Doraemon films, handled the CG for the spaceships in the film.   The Gekijō-ban Jujutsu Kaisen 0 anime film dropped from #6 to #7 in its 15th weekend. The film has sold a total of 9.5 million tickets and has earned a total of 13.32 billion yen (approximately US$108.54 million) since it opened in Japan on December 24. The film currently ranks as the 19th highest-earning film of all time in Japan, but is approaching Frozen 2 at #18, which earned a total of 13.37 billion yen.    The film is now the #1 highest-earning film at the Japanese box office from the 2021 calendar year, after surpassing Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time, according to the Mainichi Shimbun paper's Mantan Web.    The film earned 2,694,128,150 yen (about US$23.5 million) in its first three days, and topped the box office chart for its opening weekend. The film also has IMAX, 4D, and Dolby Cinema screenings.    The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story, with MAPPA animating again and TOHO distributing. Megumi Ogata voiced the main character Yuta Okkotsu, and Kana Hanazawa voiced the character Rika Orimoto.   Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, opened at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) from Friday to Sunday. The film opened on Friday in 34 theaters and had a per-theater average of about 1.13 million yen (approximately US$9,205).    The television anime's main cast and staff returned for the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE, VaVa, and OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning.   The live-action film of Kiminori Wakasugi's Kappei comedy manga fell off the top 10 rankings in its third weekend. Additionally, Eiga Oshiri Tantei Shiriarty, the first feature-length film in the Butt Detective (Oshiri Tantei), franchise dropped off the top ten rankings in its third weekend.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film Debuts at #10, Live-Action Mr. Osomatsu Stays at #2   posted on 2022-04-05 14:11 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Doraemon film stays at #3, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 drops to #7    The live-action film of the Mr. Osomatsu (Osomatsu-san) franchise stayed at #2 in its second weekend. The film sold 144,000 tickets on Saturday and Sunday, earning 213 million yen (approximately US$1.73 million). The movie has sold a total of 750,000 tickets and earned a total of 1.0 billion yen (approximately US$8.14 million).    The film opened on March 25.    In the film's story, a rich man appears, proclaiming that he will adopt one of the sextuplets. Just as the six engage in a battle royale to be the rich man's heir, three mysterious ""story-ending"" figures take on the brothers in a battle to the finish.    Tsutomu Hanabusa (Kakegurui, Tokyo Revengers live-action films) directed the film. Ryōichi Tsuchiya wrote the screenplay, and Daiki Sugawara was a producer. Cinebazar and Hachinoji produced the film for TOHO to distribute.   The Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 anime film stayed at #3 in its fifth weekend. The film sold 120,000 tickets on Saturday and Sunday to earn 149 million yen (approximately US$1.21 million). The film has sold a total of 1.78 million tickets and has earned 2.1 billion yen (approximately US$17.1 million).    The film opened at #1, and sold 350,000 tickets for 440 million yen (about US$3.81 million) in its first three days. The film opened on March 4 after a yearlong delay due to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 is the 41st film in the Doraemon franchise. The film is a remake of the 1985 Doraemon film of the same title. Susumu Yamaguchi — a key animator on many previous Doraemon movies, unit director of Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration, and the director of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE — directed the new film. Dai Sato (Eureka Seven, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Listeners) penned the script. Official HiGE DANdism created the theme song ""Universe"" specifically for the film. Sibling folk duo Billy BanBan performed the insert song ""Kokoro Arigatō"" (Thank You for the Heart). Shirogumi, the 3D CG studio behind the production of the Stand By Me Doraemon films, handled the CG for the spaceships in the film.   The Gekijō-ban Jujutsu Kaisen 0 anime film dropped from #6 to #7 in its 15th weekend. The film has sold a total of 9.5 million tickets and has earned a total of 13.32 billion yen (approximately US$108.54 million) since it opened in Japan on December 24. The film currently ranks as the 19th highest-earning film of all time in Japan, but is approaching Frozen 2 at #18, which earned a total of 13.37 billion yen.    The film is now the #1 highest-earning film at the Japanese box office from the 2021 calendar year, after surpassing Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time, according to the Mainichi Shimbun paper's Mantan Web.    The film earned 2,694,128,150 yen (about US$23.5 million) in its first three days, and topped the box office chart for its opening weekend. The film also has IMAX, 4D, and Dolby Cinema screenings.    The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story, with MAPPA animating again and TOHO distributing. Megumi Ogata voiced the main character Yuta Okkotsu, and Kana Hanazawa voiced the character Rika Orimoto.   Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, opened at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) from Friday to Sunday. The film opened on Friday in 34 theaters and had a per-theater average of about 1.13 million yen (approximately US$9,205).    The television anime's main cast and staff returned for the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE, VaVa, and OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning.   The live-action film of Kiminori Wakasugi's Kappei comedy manga fell off the top 10 rankings in its third weekend. Additionally, Eiga Oshiri Tantei Shiriarty, the first feature-length film in the Butt Detective (Oshiri Tantei), franchise dropped off the top ten rankings in its third weekend.

The film has sold a total of 9.5 million tickets and has earned a total of 13.32 billion yen (approximately US$108.54 million) since it opened in Japan on December 24. The film currently ranks as the 19th highest-earning film of all time in Japan, but is approaching Frozen 2 at #18, which earned a total of 13.37 billion yen.    The film is now the #1 highest-earning film at the Japanese box office from the 2021 calendar year, after surpassing Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time, according to the Mainichi Shimbun paper's Mantan Web.    The film earned 2,694,128,150 yen (about US$23.5 million) in its first three days, and topped the box office chart for its opening weekend. The film also has IMAX, 4D, and Dolby Cinema screenings.    The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story, with MAPPA animating again and TOHO distributing.

The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE, VaVa, and OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning.   The live-action film of Kiminori Wakasugi's Kappei comedy manga fell off the top 10 rankings in its third weekend. Additionally, Eiga Oshiri Tantei Shiriarty, the first feature-length film in the Butt Detective (Oshiri Tantei), franchise dropped off the top ten rankings in its third weekend.

The film sold 144,000 tickets on Saturday and Sunday, earning 213 million yen (approximately US$1.73 million). The movie has sold a total of 750,000 tickets and earned a total of 1.0 billion yen (approximately US$8.14 million).    The film opened on March 25.    In the film's story, a rich man appears, proclaiming that he will adopt one of the sextuplets. Just as the six engage in a battle royale to be the rich man's heir, three mysterious ""story-ending"" figures take on the brothers in a battle to the finish.    Tsutomu Hanabusa (Kakegurui, Tokyo Revengers live-action films) directed the film. Ryōichi Tsuchiya wrote the screenplay, and Daiki Sugawara was a producer. Cinebazar and Hachinoji produced the film for TOHO to distribute.   The Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 anime film stayed at #3 in its fifth weekend. The film sold 120,000 tickets on Saturday and Sunday to earn 149 million yen (approximately US$1.21 million). The film has sold a total of 1.78 million tickets and has earned 2.1 billion yen (approximately US$17.1 million).    The film opened at #1, and sold 350,000 tickets for 440 million yen (about US$3.81 million) in its first three days. The film opened on March 4 after a yearlong delay due to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Doraemon: Nobita's Little ""Star Wars"" 2021 is the 41st film in the Doraemon franchise. The film is a remake of the 1985 Doraemon film of the same title. Susumu Yamaguchi — a key animator on many previous Doraemon movies, unit director of Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration, and the director of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE — directed the new film. Dai Sato (Eureka Seven, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Listeners) penned the script. Official HiGE DANdism created the theme song ""Universe"" specifically for the film. Sibling folk duo Billy BanBan performed the insert song ""Kokoro Arigatō"" (Thank You for the Heart). Shirogumi, the 3D CG studio behind the production of the Stand By Me Doraemon films, handled the CG for the spaceships in the film.   The Gekijō-ban Jujutsu Kaisen 0 anime film dropped from #6 to #7 in its 15th weekend. The film has sold a total of 9.5 million tickets and has earned a total of 13.32 billion yen (approximately US$108.54 million) since it opened in Japan on December 24. The film currently ranks as the 19th highest-earning film of all time in Japan, but is approaching Frozen 2 at #18, which earned a total of 13.37 billion yen.    The film is now the #1 highest-earning film at the Japanese box office from the 2021 calendar year, after surpassing Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time, according to the Mainichi Shimbun paper's Mantan Web.    The film earned 2,694,128,150 yen (about US$23.5 million) in its first three days, and topped the box office chart for its opening weekend. The film also has IMAX, 4D, and Dolby Cinema screenings.    The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story, with MAPPA animating again and TOHO distributing. Megumi Ogata voiced the main character Yuta Okkotsu, and Kana Hanazawa voiced the character Rika Orimoto.   Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, opened at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) from Friday to Sunday. The film opened on Friday in 34 theaters and had a per-theater average of about 1.13 million yen (approximately US$9,205).    The television anime's main cast and staff returned for the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime.
