Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

07-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/arifureta-from-commonplace-to-world-strongest-season-2/episode-12/.184247,None Title,"                 How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

I guess I can take my time on watching this newest season then. TeamEren.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee. What a release strategist you are.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

Of course after reading the manga to it's final chapter has a lot of impact and for the artist's to take full responsibility to create what could be a tremendous animation of ""The Rumbling"" chapters that could be horrifying and unbelievable to the eyes of the audience (in other words, a very expensive animation).    I may have to wait, but being patient and to see the outcome of the final chapter of AOT will make it all worth seeing the sight to behold of this colossal story in itsspine chilling, uncontrollable and immortal work of art.

They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee. What a release strategist you are.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

Of course after reading the manga to it's final chapter has a lot of impact and for the artist's to take full responsibility to create what could be a tremendous animation of ""The Rumbling"" chapters that could be horrifying and unbelievable to the eyes of the audience (in other words, a very expensive animation).    I may have to wait, but being patient and to see the outcome of the final chapter of AOT will make it all worth seeing the sight to behold of this colossal story in itsspine chilling, uncontrollable and immortal work of art.

The content of the anime will suck either way but the whole show will now stand complete as a collection of seasons and a few OVA companions. I still don´t get why the studio switch and the rush to make final season part 1 was needed if this is the end result. Oh, Attack on Titan The Final Season Production Committee.

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

Of course after reading the manga to it's final chapter has a lot of impact and for the artist's to take full responsibility to create what could be a tremendous animation of ""The Rumbling"" chapters that could be horrifying and unbelievable to the eyes of the audience (in other words, a very expensive animation).    I may have to wait, but being patient and to see the outcome of the final chapter of AOT will make it all worth seeing the sight to behold of this colossal story in itsspine chilling, uncontrollable and immortal work of art.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever.

If there's more than, say, a month between a set of episodes, it should seriously just be considered, and advertised as, a separate season. I honestly don't get the difference between a long part of a season and a full season, especially in cases like this where there's literally a year between parts.   Deliberate or not, it feels like false advertisement to drum up hype for an epic conclusion by calling it THE FINAL SEASON more than 2 years before the actual final season even starts airing.  They should've just called it Season 4, 5 and 6 and most of the people who are bothered by this now (and there seem to be quite a few, I personally don't care that much) wouldn't have been mad at all.

Also just going to go on record and say that the ending of AOT is pretty okay. Now when the manga was finishing and people had legitimate criticisms, I was appreciative of their perspective. Unfortunately, I have since changed my mind after seeing the discourse via the anime. It appears that the reason people hate AOTs ending it because they hate how the characters are trying to stop the genocide of billions of innocent people. They are people who think Eren is a super-chad, edge-lord, badass, that Floch is based (and not a fascist) and the rest of the characters are ""cringevengers"" (???????). I would say more but the spoiler tag is giving me problems on mobile...so whatever. Just really dissapointed by the lack of good faith criticism from the 12-18 year old age grou-.....oh wait I now see the problem.    Looking forward to this!

I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. The old AoT flaw of confusing ""shouting"" with ""emotion"" is still there, but now pretty much all of the characters are awful, as anybody who was once likeable is either dead or gone to grimdark.

Premiering a ""final"" season in late 2020 and not finishing it until 2023, even though the manga ended in April 2021, is just plain bad planning by the production committee. Looking forward to spending yet another year dodging spoilers about the manga's last chapters.   Still, I'm glad they're not wrapping up the anime with one or two movies as I feared. That would only make the wait for an international release even longer, and if the final part is airing on NHK, at least it means there will be an international simulcast.

Of course after reading the manga to it's final chapter has a lot of impact and for the artist's to take full responsibility to create what could be a tremendous animation of ""The Rumbling"" chapters that could be horrifying and unbelievable to the eyes of the audience (in other words, a very expensive animation).    I may have to wait, but being patient and to see the outcome of the final chapter of AOT will make it all worth seeing the sight to behold of this colossal story in itsspine chilling, uncontrollable and immortal work of art.

(Don't @ me, FNDM)   Either way, I feel Berserk just won't be the same without Kentarou Miura.

Probably the last time the three of them will be together.    The last few chapters answered so many lingering questions, I'm not entirely sure where else the series could go but back down into the abyss, and I know my overly sensitive heart probably wouldn't be able to handle whatever comes next. I can't imagine anyone but Miura finishing what he started.

There's hope, he shared his ideas with his editor or assistants. But a continuation of the manga in another style or some imitated Miura style would just feel wrong.   I could imagine the ending in form of another medium, e.g. a novel.

All the characters are in a relatively decent place (both physically and mentally (for the most part)).   spoiler[Guts has more or less readjusted his priorities from being a revenge driven angry ass to being a tired but caring man, Casca of course still has a lot of shit to work through but at least now she has her agency back to actually do so.    I'm fine with the the way Rickert and Erica left the story. It's left open what happened to them but I'm sure they will make their way just fine. Schierke and Farnese are at a great place of learning and should be fine except for when Isidro is going to piss them off.    I also think the final panel of the Manga is absolutely perfect. To me it shows that Griffith, in the end and dispite having achieved pretty much all of his ambitions, never managed to completely emotionally detach himself from Guts and Casca. That's a very fitting and meaningful end for his arc.   In my headcanon Casca, Guts and Griffith will have a very long, angry, tearfilled conversation. Guts won't talk much and look exhausted during most of it, Casca will (rightfully) verbally shred Griffith to pieces which will hopefully help her coping with the trauma. Griffith will shut up, swollow everything he wants to say and take the blame he deserves. Then he will cut his connection from the moonlight boy and leave Casca's and Guts' lives forever. He will continue to live his life in the kingdom he created, unable to ever connect to the people around him while Guts and Casca continue to heal their wounds. ]   Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did. They don't need to add anything to what's already perfect. If they leave Berserk the way it is right now, then it will always be remembered fondly. The fact that every reader can imagine for themselves what would have happened next almost makes it even better for me. Even all the little unanswered lore details just add to the fascination.

Berserk is also my favorite manga of all time. I have reread it so many times because of how good the story and art is. I'd be frustrated that Miura-san's hiatus will take longer but also feared that he might not be able to finish his masterpiece.   Talking about Berserk, I still can't get over the fact that it will never be done. That's how much I love that manga... So I feel your frustration and hurt. It's been with everyone for so many years but I do agree with what Gilarack said:     Gilarack wrote:    Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did.

It isn't something easy to achieve and create in an instant. He really thought about the story, the character development, and every detail hard. All we can definitely do is relive the manga that he has left for us and rejoice that we were able to live in the same time as him.

(Don't @ me, FNDM)   Either way, I feel Berserk just won't be the same without Kentarou Miura.

Probably the last time the three of them will be together.    The last few chapters answered so many lingering questions, I'm not entirely sure where else the series could go but back down into the abyss, and I know my overly sensitive heart probably wouldn't be able to handle whatever comes next. I can't imagine anyone but Miura finishing what he started.

Berserk is my number 1 manga of all time and I have been reading it for over 15 years,always frustrated with Miura's hiatuses(anybody who followed that goddamn boat arc in real time should deserve an award for their patience...) and always rejoicing whenever a new chapter was announced like a big event, and always joking that is more likely he would die before he ended the damn thing(anybody who says that thought never crossed their minds is not a true Berserk fan,let's be honest here...)and then fate decides to give us exactly that...

All the characters are in a relatively decent place (both physically and mentally (for the most part)).   spoiler[Guts has more or less readjusted his priorities from being a revenge driven angry ass to being a tired but caring man, Casca of course still has a lot of shit to work through but at least now she has her agency back to actually do so.    I'm fine with the the way Rickert and Erica left the story. It's left open what happened to them but I'm sure they will make their way just fine. Schierke and Farnese are at a great place of learning and should be fine except for when Isidro is going to piss them off.    I also think the final panel of the Manga is absolutely perfect. To me it shows that Griffith, in the end and dispite having achieved pretty much all of his ambitions, never managed to completely emotionally detach himself from Guts and Casca. That's a very fitting and meaningful end for his arc.   In my headcanon Casca, Guts and Griffith will have a very long, angry, tearfilled conversation. Guts won't talk much and look exhausted during most of it, Casca will (rightfully) verbally shred Griffith to pieces which will hopefully help her coping with the trauma. Griffith will shut up, swollow everything he wants to say and take the blame he deserves. Then he will cut his connection from the moonlight boy and leave Casca's and Guts' lives forever. He will continue to live his life in the kingdom he created, unable to ever connect to the people around him while Guts and Casca continue to heal their wounds. ]   Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did. They don't need to add anything to what's already perfect. If they leave Berserk the way it is right now, then it will always be remembered fondly. The fact that every reader can imagine for themselves what would have happened next almost makes it even better for me. Even all the little unanswered lore details just add to the fascination.

Berserk is also my favorite manga of all time. I have reread it so many times because of how good the story and art is. I'd be frustrated that Miura-san's hiatus will take longer but also feared that he might not be able to finish his masterpiece.   Talking about Berserk, I still can't get over the fact that it will never be done. That's how much I love that manga... So I feel your frustration and hurt. It's been with everyone for so many years but I do agree with what Gilarack said:     Gilarack wrote:    Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did.

It isn't something easy to achieve and create in an instant. He really thought about the story, the character development, and every detail hard. All we can definitely do is relive the manga that he has left for us and rejoice that we were able to live in the same time as him.

(Don't @ me, FNDM)   Either way, I feel Berserk just won't be the same without Kentarou Miura.

Probably the last time the three of them will be together.    The last few chapters answered so many lingering questions, I'm not entirely sure where else the series could go but back down into the abyss, and I know my overly sensitive heart probably wouldn't be able to handle whatever comes next. I can't imagine anyone but Miura finishing what he started.

To me it shows that Griffith, in the end and dispite having achieved pretty much all of his ambitions, never managed to completely emotionally detach himself from Guts and Casca. That's a very fitting and meaningful end for his arc.   In my headcanon Casca, Guts and Griffith will have a very long, angry, tearfilled conversation. Guts won't talk much and look exhausted during most of it, Casca will (rightfully) verbally shred Griffith to pieces which will hopefully help her coping with the trauma. Griffith will shut up, swollow everything he wants to say and take the blame he deserves. Then he will cut his connection from the moonlight boy and leave Casca's and Guts' lives forever. He will continue to live his life in the kingdom he created, unable to ever connect to the people around him while Guts and Casca continue to heal their wounds. ]   Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did.

(Don't @ me, FNDM)   Either way, I feel Berserk just won't be the same without Kentarou Miura.

Probably the last time the three of them will be together.    The last few chapters answered so many lingering questions, I'm not entirely sure where else the series could go but back down into the abyss, and I know my overly sensitive heart probably wouldn't be able to handle whatever comes next.

Berserk is my number 1 manga of all time and I have been reading it for over 15 years,always frustrated with Miura's hiatuses(anybody who followed that goddamn boat arc in real time should deserve an award for their patience...) and always rejoicing whenever a new chapter was announced like a big event, and always joking that is more likely he would die before he ended the damn thing(anybody who says that thought never crossed their minds is not a true Berserk fan,let's be honest here...)and then fate decides to give us exactly that...

All the characters are in a relatively decent place (both physically and mentally (for the most part)).   spoiler[Guts has more or less readjusted his priorities from being a revenge driven angry ass to being a tired but caring man, Casca of course still has a lot of shit to work through but at least now she has her agency back to actually do so.    I'm fine with the the way Rickert and Erica left the story. It's left open what happened to them but I'm sure they will make their way just fine. Schierke and Farnese are at a great place of learning and should be fine except for when Isidro is going to piss them off.    I also think the final panel of the Manga is absolutely perfect. To me it shows that Griffith, in the end and dispite having achieved pretty much all of his ambitions, never managed to completely emotionally detach himself from Guts and Casca. That's a very fitting and meaningful end for his arc.   In my headcanon Casca, Guts and Griffith will have a very long, angry, tearfilled conversation. Guts won't talk much and look exhausted during most of it, Casca will (rightfully) verbally shred Griffith to pieces which will hopefully help her coping with the trauma. Griffith will shut up, swollow everything he wants to say and take the blame he deserves. Then he will cut his connection from the moonlight boy and leave Casca's and Guts' lives forever. He will continue to live his life in the kingdom he created, unable to ever connect to the people around him while Guts and Casca continue to heal their wounds. ]   Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did. They don't need to add anything to what's already perfect. If they leave Berserk the way it is right now, then it will always be remembered fondly. The fact that every reader can imagine for themselves what would have happened next almost makes it even better for me. Even all the little unanswered lore details just add to the fascination.

Berserk is also my favorite manga of all time. I have reread it so many times because of how good the story and art is. I'd be frustrated that Miura-san's hiatus will take longer but also feared that he might not be able to finish his masterpiece.   Talking about Berserk, I still can't get over the fact that it will never be done. That's how much I love that manga... So I feel your frustration and hurt. It's been with everyone for so many years but I do agree with what Gilarack said:     Gilarack wrote:    Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did.

Even all the little unanswered lore details just add to the fascination.            I don't think no one will ever do what Miura-san has done. It isn't something easy to achieve and create in an instant. He really thought about the story, the character development, and every detail hard. All we can definitely do is relive the manga that he has left for us and rejoice that we were able to live in the same time as him.

Talking about Berserk, I still can't get over the fact that it will never be done. That's how much I love that manga... So I feel your frustration and hurt. It's been with everyone for so many years but I do agree with what Gilarack said:     Gilarack wrote:    Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did. They don't need to add anything to what's already perfect. If they leave Berserk the way it is right now, then it will always be remembered fondly. The fact that every reader can imagine for themselves what would have happened next almost makes it even better for me. Even all the little unanswered lore details just add to the fascination.            I don't think no one will ever do what Miura-san has done. It isn't something easy to achieve and create in an instant. He really thought about the story, the character development, and every detail hard. All we can definitely do is relive the manga that he has left for us and rejoice that we were able to live in the same time as him.

Berserk is my number 1 manga of all time and I have been reading it for over 15 years,always frustrated with Miura's hiatuses(anybody who followed that goddamn boat arc in real time should deserve an award for their patience...) and always rejoicing whenever a new chapter was announced like a big event, and always joking that is more likely he would die before he ended the damn thing(anybody who says that thought never crossed their minds is not a true Berserk fan,let's be honest here...)and then fate decides to give us exactly that...

All the characters are in a relatively decent place (both physically and mentally (for the most part)).   spoiler[Guts has more or less readjusted his priorities from being a revenge driven angry ass to being a tired but caring man, Casca of course still has a lot of shit to work through but at least now she has her agency back to actually do so.    I'm fine with the the way Rickert and Erica left the story. It's left open what happened to them but I'm sure they will make their way just fine. Schierke and Farnese are at a great place of learning and should be fine except for when Isidro is going to piss them off.    I also think the final panel of the Manga is absolutely perfect. To me it shows that Griffith, in the end and dispite having achieved pretty much all of his ambitions, never managed to completely emotionally detach himself from Guts and Casca. That's a very fitting and meaningful end for his arc.   In my headcanon Casca, Guts and Griffith will have a very long, angry, tearfilled conversation. Guts won't talk much and look exhausted during most of it, Casca will (rightfully) verbally shred Griffith to pieces which will hopefully help her coping with the trauma. Griffith will shut up, swollow everything he wants to say and take the blame he deserves. Then he will cut his connection from the moonlight boy and leave Casca's and Guts' lives forever. He will continue to live his life in the kingdom he created, unable to ever connect to the people around him while Guts and Casca continue to heal their wounds. ]   Probably no one ever again will be able to achieve what Miura did. They don't need to add anything to what's already perfect. If they leave Berserk the way it is right now, then it will always be remembered fondly.

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

I believe the author of the light novel must have study the history of political science and then they decided to pull a Zipang or ""The Final Countdown"" and says here's what might happen if you go back in time with all the current knowledge.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.            well thats an understatement. also they showed that scene with the prime minister in black and the empire's knight princess FOR A REASON!    For eventually in later light novel volumes according to certain people, spoiler[ both of them become a couple when the saint of the empire also become souma's 4th royal wife]    though how did that end up occuring is anyone's guess!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Do you enjoy isekai shows where the the protaganist is OP and everything they do requires almost zero effort like so many of the isekai animes out there? we all enjoy a struggle but a believable struggle is hard. Honestly I don't think the whole premise of this season has reveled itself.

I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.            i have a theory about that.   the way souma acted when hearing the demon lord's name (diavolri if i remember correctly) makes me think he have heard it before but was too tired to think when.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

For eventually in later light novel volumes according to certain people, spoiler[ both of them become a couple when the saint of the empire also become souma's 4th royal wife]    though how did that end up occuring is anyone's guess!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

I was thinking the same, you don't just kill 10 (?) heads of powerful families ostensibly friendly and expect the repercussions won't be massive. Historical precedent for that sort of thing shows the bloodshed can go on for centuries! Not too smart a move..

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

For eventually in later light novel volumes according to certain people, spoiler[ both of them become a couple when the saint of the empire also become souma's 4th royal wife]    though how did that end up occuring is anyone's guess!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

I was thinking the same, you don't just kill 10 (?) heads of powerful families ostensibly friendly and expect the repercussions won't be massive. Historical precedent for that sort of thing shows the bloodshed can go on for centuries! Not too smart a move..

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

07-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/cms/discuss/184338,None Title,"   Zefram wrote:      It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

The Best and Worst Anime of Winter 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022                  Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Best and Worst Anime of Winter 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022                  Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Best and Worst Anime of Winter 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022                  Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Best and Worst Anime of Winter 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022                  Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

The Best and Worst Anime of Winter 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022                  Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,Don't Set,{}

The Best and Worst Anime of Winter 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022                  Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,Don't Set,{}

A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,Don't Set,{}

A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,Don't Set,{}
07-04-2022,anime,24,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-03-30/the-best-and-worst-anime-of-winter-2022/.184011,None Title,"                Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  I really liked the first season of Vanitas, mostly because it was practically made for me. A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives    ",positive,Don't Set,{}

A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,Don't Set,{}

A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.   ",positive,Don't Set,{}

A hyper-dramatic, indulgently gothic period fantasy with immaculate direction and storyboarding was basically everything I could ask for in a junk food show. But somewhere along the way, the series managed to be not “just” an indulgent exercise in gothic tragedy, but a genuinely compelling, character-driven story with a lot of worthwhile things to say. Characters who started off as simple jokes slowly developed an earnest, engaging pathos. Personality traits that at first seemed like broad charm points metamorphosed into tragic, effecting pieces of their larger, complicated history.    And in this second half all those elements came to the forefront while also supercharging the original charm of its gothic imagery and decadence. The result is a show that goes down smooth as butter with its high-concept steampunk action, but still lingers in your heart as you start to recognize the hidden meaning behind each character's quirks. But it's also a show that can stop all that on a dime and turn into a Victorian-era romantic comedy straight out of my high school fanfiction.net bookmarks, delivered with the same confidence and passion that made its serious elements compelling. It's a full package that is always compulsively watchable, and I seriously hope we can get more eventually.    Runner-up: Sabikui Bisco   Entirely on the other end of the spectrum, there's nothing particularly deep about the characters or world of this Mad Max-inspired rollercoaster, but there doesn't really need to be. Sometimes a show is just good because it's constantly, infectiously entertaining, and that fits Sabikui Bisco to a T. There's the cartoonish monster designs that the cast approach with totally straight faces. The wild action sequences that turn mushrooms into WMDs. The way every single drawing of Pawoo is the coolest thing ever put to screen, only to be one-upped the next time she shows up. It's just a blast from start to finish, and is absolutely worth everyone and anyone's time.      Worst: Platinum End  Let's not mince words here. Platinum End was guaranteed to be the worst thing I watched this season before this season even started. The series' first cour was a sloppy mess that flailed around with its poorly-structured death game like a confused toddler writhing in a pool of fake blood. But the second act of this squandered mess lost even that energy as it somehow found new depths of incompetence to spelunk once its main villain was out of the picture.    The back-half of Platinum End isn't so much a television show as it is an animated simulation of showing up to a 7 am university lecture with a splitting migraine, where you slowly realize the TA delivering it is hungover and ad-libbing the entire thing. It's at once long-winded and totally vacuous, gesturing vaguely in the direction of interesting or controversial topics without ever saying anything of substance about any of it. Religion, existentialism, geopolitical strife, inequality, and a dozen other heady subjects that a good show – or even an ambitious bad show – could turn into something complex and dramatic; all of them taken out, set on the kitchen counter, and then forgotten after the creator got distracted with a phone call, returning days later to find they've rotted or gone stale in the interim.    Then there's the finale – an ending so infamous it was likely the only reason anyone stuck around through this interminable failure of a narrative. And it is indeed a worthless conclusion that only functions to make the already miserable story preceding it even more meaningless. It's the kind of baldly stupid ending that writers and viewers alike mock on instinct. Rocks fall, everyone dies? Try God kills himself, everyone dies! It's a thoroughly lazy attempt at the kind of haunting nihilism that made Devilman's original ending so famous, but all it manages to do is insult anyone who might have actually been invested in its story, and admitting to everyone watching ironically that it never had anything worth saying from the start.       Best: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc  I just managed to catch up with Demon Slayer before this season ended and I'm glad that I did so I could finally join everybody else on the hype train. I wouldn't call Demon Slayer my favorite shōnen series but there is a lot of charm in its overall simplicity. Cute, likable characters overcoming difficult hardships has always been a classic yet endearing narrative and a part of me is disappointed that we seem to be moving away from that for the sake of glorious spectacle. But what a glorious spectacle it is! The setup and execution might be simple, but it's led to some of the most gorgeously-animated fights I think the community has seen in quite some time. This was my dose of adrenaline during a very drawn-out and difficult few months. While I do think the overall pacing of The Entertainment District Arc feels a bit more sluggish compared to the previous arcs, it still manages to keep the tension building and make me all the more curious to see where all of this leads!    Runner-up: My Dress-Up Darling   A lot of people have a lot of thoughts about My Dress-Up Darling. Some found its fanservice to be too blatant and uncomfortable, while some felt that the show's coverage of its subject matter is rather limited in scope, especially when factoring in other cosplay cultures outside Japan. All of these are valid opinions of the show, and my biggest complaint is that it didn't really expand upon a lot of the ideas and worldviews about cosplay that it brings up. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that this anime embodies some of the best qualities that I think the slice-of-life genre has to offer. Not only does the show look beautiful with creative shots and fluid character animations that properly highlight the emotions of the characters involved, but when it comes down to those individual character relationships, there is quite a lot of strong writing on display here. And even when they do touch upon some uncomfortable territory at times, the actions of the cast almost always come from a believable character place, with a romance dynamic that prioritizes individual character growth alongside romantic progression. It doesn't push the limits of the slice-of-life or romantic comedy genres, but it definitely has a strong enough heart that a lot of people can resonate with, even if the details might not be able to reach everybody. At the very least, it's that beating heart that has endeared me to the show, and all the other details like its cosplay subject matter and the high production values are just added bonuses.      Worst: In the Land of Leadale  When I first started watching The Land of Leadale, I admittedly came to the realization that the show wasn't fitting into the mold of what I expected it to be. Upon realizing this, I did my best to figure out what the show was trying to do so that I could judge it on its own merits. The problem is, I'm not sure if the show itself even knows that: it couldn't seem to decide if it wants to be a suspenseful mystery, an over-the-top power fantasy, a weird reactionary comedy, or a touching narrative about self-discovery and family. All of those are interesting ideas that the show could've easily leaned into, and based on some of the responses to my reviews that I've gotten in the past couple of weeks, the original source material actually expands upon those ideas rather well. But in the anime, plot points are introduced without much buildup and most of them are dependent on information that's only implied at best. All of this is spearheaded by a main character that comes off as directionless as the show's narrative about her newfound life. She shifts from generic fantasy trope to generic fantasy trope only for everything to get dropped just for the sake of sitting down and having a quiet peaceful life with an adoptive daughter that we barely know anything about. After sitting through 12 episodes of this rather mundane isekai, I was forced to accept that basically none of it really mattered in the end and I'm left with this overwhelming feeling that I wasted my time.       Best: My Dress-Up Darling  On its surface, My Dress Up Darling appears to be a cute little love story between a socially awkward guy and a popular, outgoing girl. However, what sets it apart from the standard manic pixie dream girl fare is that it's not about Kitagawa “fixing” Gojō. Instead, it's about how they help each other get closer to reaching their respective dreams and grow as people in the process. Kitagawa gets to transform into the characters she loves through his costumes and Gojō learns more about tailoring, make-up, and hairstyling—all things that make him grow as a doll maker.    But what's really great about this show is its fantastic moral: It's okay to like the things you like, no matter your gender, age, or body size. You can be a young man who thinks dolls are the most beautiful things in the world, or you can be a beautiful girl who likes hardcore porn games. What's important isn't finding people that share your interests as much as it is finding those who respect them. Gojō is traumatized as a kid when his best friend rejects him for his hobby. Kitagawa, on the other hand, has found friends who don't share her interests but do accept them. Now, she is being the same kind of friend to him despite not really caring about doll-making. And in the end, what draws the two together is the simple fact that nothing is more attractive than being passionate about something (which is another excellent moral in itself).    Runner-Up: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc   Coming off the events of Mugen Train, the heroes of Demon Slayer are at their lowest point. But no sooner have they recovered physically than they are thrown into an equally dangerous situation. Plotwise, this season is all about giving the heroes the win they so desperately need—though that's not to say it isn't filled with numerous twists, turns, and sacrifices along the way.    But what's exceptional about this season is how it develops Tanjirō and Nezuko through the arc's villains. Daki and Gyutaro are basically twisted versions of our heroic siblings, an example of what would have happened if they had both become demons. But the more fundamental difference between the two pairs is that Tanjirō and Nezuko had a loving family to support them before tragedy struck. It is her memory of them that lets Nezuko retain her humanity despite her demon form, and the same pushes Tanjirō on even when he has nothing left to give. The reason anyone survives this arc is solely due to the bond between the Kamado siblings, and the compassion Tanjirō and Nezuko share with the mass-murdering pair in their final moments reaffirms their bond in tear-jerking fashion.       Worst: She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man   As usual, I need to start by mentioning that this is not the worst anime of the season by a long shot. (Judging by the first episode alone, I'd think that Rusted Armors would win that title easily). However, this is the worst anime I continued watching. Out of the several OP protagonist isekai anime out this season, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man was the one I was holding out hope for. Frankly, I liked the twist on the formula: a person used to RPing as an old man is reincarnated in a game world as a young girl. There's a lot of story potential here, between Mira's sudden sex change and the mystery of why she and other players have been reincarnated in the game world.    Unfortunately, the show never really lives up to that potential. Beyond shallow comedy (like a young girl talking like an old man, or an old man learning how to pee as a girl), very little is truly explored about Mira's new situation. The plot mostly involves Mira simply overpowering any enemy she comes across while everyone around her is starstruck by how cool she is. In the end, it's just another in a long line of surface-level power fantasies—and with its premise, it could have been so much more.          Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Season 2  I feel like I'm always in the position that my pick for the best is one episode away from being finished before this deadline, but in this particular case, it would have to screw up in the most epic of ways to destroy everything that has come before it. The Case Study of Vanitas' second season does what every good sequel should: follow up on the previous storyline in ways that enhances both what came before and the current actions. Previously we knew very little about Vanitas himself, and that was very much by design; Vanitas has been remarkably dedicated to keeping his own past under wraps. This contrasted nicely with Noé, who is much more of an open book, wearing his emotions and his trauma on his sleeve, not because he enjoys wallowing, but because that's how he best copes with them, but remembering and embracing what has come before. Now in the second season Vanitas' reasons for taking the opposite approach come to the fore in ways that don't always appear to be happening – long before the showdown with Mikhaïl, we're learning about what Vanitas' reasons might be for hiding things through a beautifully realized journey through a closed time loop created by Chloé, a curse-bearing vampire. In Chloé's sadness and need to hide in the past from the present we can see that Vanitas' hourglass earring is symbolic of his own treatment of time. His bottom glass is mostly (if not entirely) full, indicating that his time has run out, which is how Chloé sees her life from the moment she became a vampire in the distant past. And while Vanitas is willing to fight Naenia and Charlatan for Chloé's time to begin moving forward again, that's not something he's willing to do for himself.    In the ending theme for this season we see Vanitas and Noé sitting in different bulbs of an hourglass, Vanitas in the top looking down at the running sands and Noé in the bottom looking up to Vanitas. While this would seem to be contrary to the imagery the rest of the story sets up for them, it actually isn't, because Noé is watching time as it moves, while Vanitas is unable to see anything but the ostensibly stationary sand beneath him – until it runs out to the point where he can't ignore it anymore. This dovetails with the Mikhaïl storyline, where we learn about Vanitas' inability to move on from his past with Dr. Moreau and the original Vampire of the Blue Moon, or even the horrors of his father's death in his childhood. Vanitas isn't even aware that time is passing, instead devoting himself to others while ignoring the toll on himself. He's his own Louis, which is why he has such a difficult time accepting that Noé and Jeanne could actually like him – because in his own mind, it's already too late. The way all of this comes together is exquisitely done in a combination of actions and symbols, and even if it has its moments of unevenness, it is absolutely worth watching. Vanitas and Noé aren't quite two sides of the same coin, but they are two people who are better together than by themselves – if only Vanitas can accept that he doesn't have to remain frozen in a hell of his own mind.    Runner-Up: Waccha PriMagi!   Unlike my first choice, my second isn't symbolic or particularly deep. But few things have brought me as much joy as this series this season, and in its second cour Waccha PriMagi! has continued to be a delight that's also just a little bit more thoughtful than you might expect. Now that Matsuri is firmly established as one of the top five PriMagi Stars, the focus shifts to getting the girls to work together for reasons that    are starting to feel increasingly suspect. No one's really said anything about what's going on, but Jennifer's reaction to the whole thing – plus the fact that she's barely performed in quite some time – indicates that there's a lot more going on than anyone wants to admit to their lovely little waccha factories. Only Hughie seems to be remotely interested in the girls' wellbeing, and even if it wasn't a delight to watch him attempt to be besties with Touma (and it absolutely is), it'd be easy to see that he's keeping a close eye on what's going on to the point of whisking them away to a special “training camp.” Add in more excellent character development, this time mostly for Miruki (poster child for the curated online life) and Amane, plenty of sparkle, and a story that doesn't talk down to its intended audience, and this is just a good time – more than I ever expected it to be.    Finally, I do just want to mention Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout. I was down on its first episode, but when my twenty-year-old cat decided that she wasn't getting off my lap for hours, I ended up watching more, and I am happy to say that I was wrong about it. I ended up really enjoying it, for which I have one clingy kitty to thank.       Most Mediocre: Futsal Boys!!!!!   On this one my cat was considerably less kind, because this is the other one I ended up following after I ran out of the other show on that day. Terry Pratchett made a variety of pointed and unkind remarks about the overuse of exclamation points in his novels, and I'm sorry to say that this series kind of proves him right, because its apparent enthusiasm for its subject matter does not extend into creating an actually good show. It isn't terrible, but it does feel a lot like a bunch of people sat down in a room, brainstormed a list of things ladies like in all-male casts, and then tried to throw as many of them into the series as humanly possible. So there's a team sport, tragic pasts of varying degrees, familiar character relationships, fancy schools with fussy uniforms (for both regular AND sports outfits), foreign blond guys, and a team made up entirely of entertainment professionals who all go to the same high school. Then the story madly dashes ahead to try and fit everything into twelve episodes, including two tournaments it really doesn't have time for, resulting in decent ideas that just don't have the room to breathe and grow. Futsal Boys!!!!! really could have used fewer characters and more directed focus on them, but as it stands, it's kind of a mess, the anime equivalent of garbage salad – a salad made by throwing everything in the cabinet and fridge into a bowl of lettuce and calling it “dinner.”         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  A good hobby series communicates the feelings of enjoyment for the activity it's created in service of. That could be accomplished by running down the interesting details or technicalities behind the efforts, hoping the audience latches onto appreciation for the work and all that goes into it. Alternatively, you can just show us some cute kids getting adorably excited about this thing they're into. My Dress-Up Darling definitely knows how to showcase the technical craft of cosplay, to be sure, but it was the scene of its main heroine Marin giddily hopping up and down with happiness over the prospect of pulling off her dream costume that made me realize this was going to be one of those 'special' shows that communicated its joys with sheer, infectious enthusiasm.    Of course, a visual medium like an anime series depicting the designs of a visuals-based activity like cosplay means a whole lot of the appeal here is communicated…visually. And that's another reason for My Dress-Up Darling's success, that the army of animators working under CloverWorks on this project were so up to the task. Marin's outsized emotions like that aforementioned bouncing-around are easily-notable standout moments, but the show also succeeds on the smaller, more concentrated examples of character emoting. It allows you to feel the energy underscoring Gojo's efforts at cosplay-craft or notice the personal details of the characters that come through as they're 'acting' as other characters while posing for costumed photos. It also lets the series simply show off, in the case where the animators delivered lavishly-produced tributes to late-90's magical girl series that did an effective job of convincing me why all the people in this story thought it was the coolest thing ever. 'Joy' really is the feeling I keep coming back to with My Dress-Up Darling, and the show's ability to consistently communicate and instill it made it easily the best thing I watched this season.    Runner-Up: Sabikui Bisco   There is so much going on in Sabikui Bisco. It's a light-novel-based series that feels more like it sprung from a shonen manga. It has a wild array of twists and turns and upheavals over its run despite this cour adapting only the first volume of the story. It has a giant crab named Actagawa that the characters ride around on! I don't know what more I could ask for. Okay, I suppose I could just ask for 'more of this show', since that single-volume adaptational status means there's still plenty more story to cover even with this season finished. And for a setting that seems rather inexplicably obtuse at the start, I think I've actually grown quite engrossed by this odd, mushroom-based world. To say nothing of the endearment I've developed for good boys Bisco and Milo themselves. The pair end up with an extremely unique, complex relationship over the course of the series and a couple of genuinely shocking swerves along the way, which feeds into what I think I most appreciated about this anime. I consistently thought I had figured out where a given plot point or setup was going, only for the show to surprise me with a switch which still worked perfectly for what it had prepared. That's the strongest recommendation I can give for Sabikui Bisco: If you still haven't checked this series out, it's a great one to go into as blindly as possible.       Worst: Tokyo 24th Ward   Sometimes I can tell from a mile away what the worst show I'll be watching in a given season will be. Being on the review beat means I usually 'get' to follow at least one obvious loser I wouldn't watch all the way through otherwise. But other times, the forthcoming failure is less obvious. Tokyo 24th Ward had some compelling, if ham-fisted, concepts it was putting forward to explore, with the more immediate potential issues being borne out of the tightrope its production was publicly walking. But even amongst some dodgy art QC and having to take multiple weeks off, that ended up not being the most damning aspect of the show. No, Tokyo 24th Ward's issue is another all too common affliction: It is a very stupid story that thinks it is very smart. So it goes that we have to endure weeks of the writing trying to articulate political horseshoe theory about anarchy against a surveillance state being just as bad as the government oppression itself. It's a world where unknowingly receiving backing from agenda-driven elites for anti-government graffiti is posited as being as bad as shoving your daughter's corpse in a tube to power the world's most idiotic anti-crime algorithm. It's a series that throws characters into enactments of the trolley problem, then has someone point out that it's a trolley problem, like nerds in an isekai series constantly exclaiming which particular RPG or anime reference they've happened upon. Of all the track-switching fates Tokyo 24th Ward has entertained, maybe a full-on production meltdown would have been the kinder tragedy to befall it, as that might have managed to distract from how mind-numbingly agonizing its conceptual storytelling is.         Best: My Dress-Up Darling  It's not often that a romcom earns my top honors for the season, but My Dress-Up Darling is just that fresh and fun a take on the genre. While its charming leads and varyingly horny spelunking into the world of cosplay fashion are great hooks in and of themselves, the darling devil is in the dress-up details. The series takes an extremely earnest look at both the minutiae of piecing costumes together and the experience of geek culture, and the result feels authentic without any cloying aftertaste. Marin, with her cluttered bedroom shrine to anime bosoms of all sizes and mile-a-minute explanations of depraved visual novels, is one of the most authentic personifications of otaku culture I've ever seen. Of course, she's also an orbital laser cannon armed with desirable girlfriendly qualities aimed right at the target audience's most vulnerable spots, but she's so real. I know Marins! I have a Marin inside of me ready to explode at the slightest mention of a particular set of series. She walks among us.    Gojo, however, is the more easily overlooked glue holding the show together. If he were a generic self- insert, My Dress-Up Darling would never have risen beyond middling. Instead, he's a compelling character in his own right, with goals and anxieties that intersect and resonate with Marin's in colorful ways. He's also plenty attractive himself, and Marin knows it. Her teenage infatuation slathers on an additional layer of butterflies and charm to the season's second half, deftly side-stepping common romcom will-they-won't-they woes with further earnestness. Anyone who's ever had a crush in high school can relate to her going gaga over everything Gojo does, from his handsome smile to his dead- eyed all-nighter stare. Their chemistry is beyond precious.    The show has its shortcomings and blind spots—most egregiously with how it broaches the subject of Marin darkening her skin for a midseason cosplay, seemingly oblivious to the controversies of the practice. A story so adamant about extolling the broad appeal of cosplay should have been able to do better. But on nearly every other front, the adaptation slays with its emphasis on its creators' visions and frequent embellishments upon the source material, towards ends both sentimental and depraved. The manga is fantastic to begin with, and the anime somehow manages to improve on it. For me, it's winter's runaway winner.    Runner-Up: Ranking of Kings   Honestly, I don't think the second half of Ranking of Kings completely fulfills the setup and promise of its first half. However, that's a difficult complaint to not make when the first half was a nearly perfect concatenation of mind- and world-expanding concepts tracing the show's evolution into an ambitious and heartwarming take on fairy tale adventures. Sensitively written and impeccably animated, Ranking of Kings at its best is up there with some of the best anime to ever air. And it's certainly the best anime with a shadowy fried egg sidekick.    Unfortunately, ending stories is a lot more difficult than starting them. I'm sympathetic to some of Ranking's woes, because tying so many story threads together into a coherent conclusion is an unenviable task. Some slowdown was inevitable, and even then, Bojji's story still manages to paint an uncommonly beautiful picture. I'm less sympathetic to the thoughtless evocations of colonialist mindsets, especially ones that hew so closely to a history of horrible imperialism this is not as far removed, neither temporally nor effectually, as we'd like to believe. Like with my number one pick Dress-Up Darling, it sucks to see these blemishes on otherwise kind and generous series. Overall, though, they each possess too much of a surfeit of good for me to ignore. They are flawed masterworks, yet masterworks all the same.      Worst, and It's All You Guys' Fault: World’s End Harem  I mean, I couldn't possibly choose anything else. I can foresee Platinum End usurping this rank once I catch up on the turgid nihilism of its second half later this week, but nobody should be upset with me digging World’s End Harem back out of the dumpster for one last textual whipping. This is an anime that prompted me to use the phrase “maidenless behavior” in a professional critical setting. It's bad. I had hoped, when I received the assignment you all so graciously voted for in the beginning of the season, that it would at least provide me with some ironic enjoyment. And it certainly did have its moments. The intersection of absurd porn setups, even more absurd speculative science fiction, and the crème de la crème absurdity of the censorship made for some hilarious episodes. I gave a select handful high marks, and I meant it! Overall, however, World’s End Harem has a really nasty misogynistic riptide that pulled my best efforts to enjoy myself into the deep trenches of nerd entitlement. That is to say, Doi's material sucks. It starts miserable, picks up a bit when the entire gaggle of schoolgirls are vying to jump his witless bones, and the nosedives into navel-gazing nausea. It's not like the other story threads are good, because they're not, but Doi soaks up half of the runtime with his staid high school harem hedonism—both too vanilla to be actually, entertainingly hedonistic, and too embittered to be anything but the ravings of a born loser. It's a great show to hate, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about it.         Best: The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2  You ever watch the first half of an anime and then you're like “Alright, that was pretty good.” but then you get to the second half and the production values drop and the writing quality dips, and it makes you feel like a wet blanket for investing your time in the first place? I've seen it happen several times, especially in the COVID years. Which makes me extremely relieved to say that The Case Study of Vanitas doesn't do that, and the only disasters that appear are loveable but humanly flawed characters, all of whom I stan. Studio Bone's adaption of Mochijun's gorgeous historical fantasy vampire manga stays strong from the first half. The second half perfectly expands on the premise of the first, expanding the major plot and the characters and presenting the story with dynamic, cathartic, and most of all, an extremely entertaining performance. I loved seeing the growth of Vanitas and Jean, and I even ended up cozying up to some of the recent arc's antagonists and side characters. Throughout both cours Vanitas delivers a plethora of haunting gothic imagery, fun character beats, heartbreaking tragic backstories, thrilling action, even a little romance *wink* (Ooh La La!) It's a crème de la crème for classic anime-enjoyers who seek a little bit of everything, and it really feels like it's being slept on by a wide audience who might get a kick out of it. Crawl out of your coffins already, why don't you?! The night's still young.    Runner-Up: Sasaki and Miyano   Speaking of romances, this is a really great time for fans of romance anime of all stripes and colors. Maybe too good! I had extremely tough time deciding between this anime and my other favorite romance this season My Dress-Up Darling, another anime I also love a whole lot. Picking between them felt like trying to pick favorite children, but ultimately what made me pick Sasaki and Miyano was how well it captures the slow day-to-day life moments. Its acknowledgement of both internal and external roadblocks towards our personal feelings, especially queer ones. At first Sasaki and Miyano might feel rather modest in both production and story. And in some ways, it is, but it's able to nail the atmosphere and timing in a way that feels intimate. It's a slow-burning story but warm and comforting that makes it the perfect anime to snuggle up to with a mug and a blanket after a rough day and unwind as you watch the boys struggle with all their fuzzy feelings. It was exactly the anime the doctor ordered to soothe my chronic anime burnout syndrome. I found recognition in Miyano's struggle with his feelings, and I admired Sasaki's respect to give Miyano the space he needed to figure himself out. Even if it created a lot of classic romance frustration and Yearning™ along the way, all that build up caps off in its extremely satisfying final episode. Making it a great singular watch that anyone can jump into.      Worst: Tribe Nine  Writing this one hurts. I've always been a big fan of noted Danganronpa game franchise's creator Kazutaka Kodaka's writing. His work hits a sweet spot for its fun, trashy humor, over-the-top characters, and cerebral world-building. While not everyone's cup of tea, I can't say his work has ever been dull. But for an equally long time as I've been a fan there's been a struggle to translate what makes his work interesting in adaption to anime format. I found the anime adaption of the first Danganronpa game to be underwhelming, underbudgeted, and underdeveloped. Then the Danganronpa 3 anime never lived up to its ambitions and came off as unfocused. It wasn't until the release of the wholly anime original Akudama Drive that I thought that I'd never see one of my favorite writers succeed in fully animated glory, landing itself as one of my favorite anime in recent years. (I even ordered the Blu-ray for my birthday.)    So, despite past disappointments, for a brief spell, I had felt the curse had been lifted and so I had high hopes for the adaption of this latest mobile RPG featuring urban extreme baseball. Like how you could you make such a ridiculous premise such as “Danganronpa Cyberpunk Baseball Anime” and make it feel stiff and boring?! Well first you can give it the budget of half a sandwich, throw it on the ground, followed by stepping on it for good measure, and that's how you recreate the formula for how Tribe Nine was made. It's production is extremely limited for a sports anime. Linden Films flattens Rui Komatsuzaki's original volumetric art style and never unifies the popping colors of its characters and world. It might actually be uglier and more stiff than previous disappointment Farewell, My Dear Cramer. But even if it could barely animate a ball hitting a stick, I'm not sure if it would've delivered any homeruns. The characters are quirky but they and the world of XB feels barebones with not much to push the premise into being engaging even for a more standard sports anime. The other teams don't fare much better. And most of all, I couldn't really enjoy them. I found most of the jokes one-note, or unfunny, even if some would get an occasional laugh out of me. It's not the complete worst, if anything I'd overall describe it as “mid,” but compared to everything else I was watching, Tribe Nine struck out.  ",positive,Don't Set,{}

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange.

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

07-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-05/.184359,None Title,"       This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.

Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting.

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era.

After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese.

Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.

There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

07-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-05/.184359,None Title,"        Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace.
