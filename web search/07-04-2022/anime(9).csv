Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          4 comments       Doraemon Co-Creator Fujiko Fujio A Passes Away at 88   Apr  7, 14:41 4 comments                 manga    Artist also known as Motoo Abiko later created Ninja Hattori-kun, Kaibutsu-kun, Pro Golfer Saru, Warau Salesman manga ― Manga creator and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away on Thursday morning at his residence in Kawasaki, Tokyo.

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff.

SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form.

Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.

Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives    ",positive,Don't Set,{}
07-04-2022,anime,6,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-03-31/our-most-anticipated-anime-of-spring-2022/.184010,None Title,"          Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time.

I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!

07-04-2022,anime,6,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-03-31/our-most-anticipated-anime-of-spring-2022/.184010,None Title,"      Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls.

News Bubble Anime Film's Trailer Highlights Story   posted on 2022-04-07 08:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film debuts worldwide on Netflix on April 28, opens in Japanese theaters on MAy 13    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming a new trailer on Thursday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. The trailer introduces the film's story, focusing on the song that only Hibiki and Uta can hear.         Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Eve performs the newly created opening theme song ""Bubble feat. Uta.""    Singer-songwriter Riria. performs the ending theme song ""Jaa ne, Mata ne."" (See You, Catch You Later.) ""Riria."" (written with a period.) gained fans when she began posting songs on TikTok and YouTube without revealing her face in the fall of 2019, and she has since garnered over 1.7 million followers across several social media platforms. She is not only singing the ending theme song but also voicing the heroine Uta. This is the first voice-acting role for Rina., who was personally requested by director Tetsuro Araki and producer Genki Kawamura.     The characters in the top row (left to right) in the visual above include protagonists Hibiki (Jun Shison) and Uta (Riria.), the scientist Makoto (Alice Hirose), and Shin (Mamoru Miyano). The characters in the bottom row (left to right) include Kai (Yuuki Kaji), Usagi (Sayaka Senbongi), the leader of Denki Ninja (Tasuku Hatanaka), the leader of Undertaker (Marina Inoue), and the leader of Kantō Mad Lobster (Shinichiro Miki).    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    In 2018, Netfix announced a comprehensive business alliance with Production I.G and BONES on Wednesday.
