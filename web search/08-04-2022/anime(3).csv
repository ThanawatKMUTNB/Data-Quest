News Utano☆Princesama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours Film's Teaser Showcases Matching White Captain's Uniforms, Main Staff   posted on 2022-04-06 19:35 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          UtaPri: Maji Love Kingdom staff reunite for September 2 film    The staff for Gekijō-ban Utano☆Princesama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours, the upcoming film in the Utano☆Princesama franchise, posted the film's teaser trailer on Wednesday. The teaser showcases the film's ""live concert animation"" sequences, particularly one with the members in matching white captain's uniforms:        The teaser's description also lists more main staff member. Chika Nagaoka (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Detective Conan: The Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet) is directing the anime, and Maki Fujioka (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, ItaKiss, Wolf Girl & Black Prince) is adapting the original character designs from the franchise's Chinatsu Kurahana (Aquarion Evol, Samurai Flamenco).    Hiroshi Nakajima (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV) is directing the CG, and Takeshi Ohkawa is serving as sub-CG director (InuYasha the Movie 4: Fire on the Mystic Island). Katsuyoshi Miyajima (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, AKB0048 next stage, Love Live! School idol project) is the character modeling director.     The film — described as part of a ""new theatrical film series"" — will be entirely composed of concert footage of the ST☆RISH idol group. Noriyasu Agematsu is once again credited as the original creator with Broccoli. Elements Garden is composing the music, and A-1 Pictures is producing the film. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The returning cast includes:     Takuma Terashima as Otoya Ittoki   Kenichi Suzumura as Masato Hijirikawa   Kishō Taniyama as Natsuki Shinomiya   Mamoru Miyano as Tokiya Ichinose   Junichi Suwabe as Ren Jingūji   Hiro Shimono as Shō Kurusu   Kousuke Toriumi as Cecil Aijima    The film will open in Japan on September 2.    The franchise will also have a one-hour television anime special that celebrates the 10th anniversary of the 2011 Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000% television anime, as well as the release of the film.    Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000%, the first anime season adapting Broccoli's dating simulation video game for female players, premiered in Japan in July 2011. In the first season of the slapstick romantic comedy, the female protagonist goes to a school for the performing arts with young men who are budding idols. The subsequent seasons followed seven of the young men after they form the idol group ST☆RISH. The 13-episode second season, Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 2000%, premiered in Japan in April 2013. The 13-episode third season, Utano☆Princesama Revolutions, premiered in April 2015. The 13-episode fourth season, Utano☆Princesama Legend Star, premiered in October 2016.    The Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom film then opened in Japan in June 2019. Sentai Filmworks, which licensed the previous four television anime seasons and the film, describes the film's story:   What's better than a concert by one of your favorite singing groups? A concert by three of your favorite singing groups, of course! That's what lucky fans get when three of the most popular vocal groups from the UTANO☆PRINCESAMA franchise all come together for a single epic motion picture performance. Have you got your tickets yet? If you have, come join ST*RISH, QUARTET NIGHT, and HE*VENS as they all take to the stage! It's an epic battle of the bands where there's no battle and everyone wins in Utano Princesama Maji LOVE Kingdom!

News Utano☆Princesama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours Film's Teaser Showcases Matching White Captain's Uniforms, Main Staff   posted on 2022-04-06 19:35 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          UtaPri: Maji Love Kingdom staff reunite for September 2 film    The staff for Gekijō-ban Utano☆Princesama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours, the upcoming film in the Utano☆Princesama franchise, posted the film's teaser trailer on Wednesday. The teaser showcases the film's ""live concert animation"" sequences, particularly one with the members in matching white captain's uniforms:        The teaser's description also lists more main staff member. Chika Nagaoka (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Detective Conan: The Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet) is directing the anime, and Maki Fujioka (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, ItaKiss, Wolf Girl & Black Prince) is adapting the original character designs from the franchise's Chinatsu Kurahana (Aquarion Evol, Samurai Flamenco).    Hiroshi Nakajima (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV) is directing the CG, and Takeshi Ohkawa is serving as sub-CG director (InuYasha the Movie 4: Fire on the Mystic Island). Katsuyoshi Miyajima (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, AKB0048 next stage, Love Live! School idol project) is the character modeling director.     The film — described as part of a ""new theatrical film series"" — will be entirely composed of concert footage of the ST☆RISH idol group. Noriyasu Agematsu is once again credited as the original creator with Broccoli. Elements Garden is composing the music, and A-1 Pictures is producing the film. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The returning cast includes:     Takuma Terashima as Otoya Ittoki   Kenichi Suzumura as Masato Hijirikawa   Kishō Taniyama as Natsuki Shinomiya   Mamoru Miyano as Tokiya Ichinose   Junichi Suwabe as Ren Jingūji   Hiro Shimono as Shō Kurusu   Kousuke Toriumi as Cecil Aijima    The film will open in Japan on September 2.    The franchise will also have a one-hour television anime special that celebrates the 10th anniversary of the 2011 Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000% television anime, as well as the release of the film.    Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000%, the first anime season adapting Broccoli's dating simulation video game for female players, premiered in Japan in July 2011. In the first season of the slapstick romantic comedy, the female protagonist goes to a school for the performing arts with young men who are budding idols. The subsequent seasons followed seven of the young men after they form the idol group ST☆RISH. The 13-episode second season, Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 2000%, premiered in Japan in April 2013. The 13-episode third season, Utano☆Princesama Revolutions, premiered in April 2015. The 13-episode fourth season, Utano☆Princesama Legend Star, premiered in October 2016.    The Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom film then opened in Japan in June 2019. Sentai Filmworks, which licensed the previous four television anime seasons and the film, describes the film's story:   What's better than a concert by one of your favorite singing groups? A concert by three of your favorite singing groups, of course! That's what lucky fans get when three of the most popular vocal groups from the UTANO☆PRINCESAMA franchise all come together for a single epic motion picture performance. Have you got your tickets yet? If you have, come join ST*RISH, QUARTET NIGHT, and HE*VENS as they all take to the stage! It's an epic battle of the bands where there's no battle and everyone wins in Utano Princesama Maji LOVE Kingdom!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

The video previews the new Virtual Reality, Truth Reenactment, and Wink Psync segments.      The game will get costume and t-shirt DLC that will be available until July 14.    The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam in North America and Europe on June 24. The game was originally scheduled for a worldwide spring launch.    The story will feature new characters Ryuki and Tama.    Spike Chunsoft describes the new game:    Six years ago, the right half of a corpse was discovered under mysterious circumstances. The left half was never found...until six years later, when it was discovered completely fresh with no signs of decay, as though the victim was alive until just recently. Now, newly-appointed Special Agent Mizuki and her AI partner Aiba are tasked to solve the bizarre Half Body serial killings...  The game will have both regular and collector's editions, with the latter including an Aiba figure, an art book, and a soundtrack.    AI: The Somnium Files launched for the PS4, Switch, and PC via Steam worldwide in September 2019.

Spike Chunsoft describes the new game:    Six years ago, the right half of a corpse was discovered under mysterious circumstances. The left half was never found...until six years later, when it was discovered completely fresh with no signs of decay, as though the victim was alive until just recently. Now, newly-appointed Special Agent Mizuki and her AI partner Aiba are tasked to solve the bizarre Half Body serial killings...  The game will have both regular and collector's editions, with the latter including an Aiba figure, an art book, and a soundtrack.

Youth Time Travel Manga Ends   posted on 2022-04-05 16:47 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Bonjin Hirameki's manga based on Nachi Kio's novel series launched in 2018; novels inspired TV anime last year    Kodansha's Magazine Pocket website published the final chapter of Bonjin Hirameki's manga adaptation of author Nachi Kio and illustrator Eretto's Boku-tachi no Remake (Remake Our Life!) light novel series on Monday. The final chapter consists of two parts, which debuted on March 21 and Monday, respectively.    The story centers on the unsuccessful game director Kyōya Hashiba. His company goes bankrupt, and he ends up returning to his parents' home. He lies in bed thinking about the successful creators of his generation. When he opens his eyes, Kyōya finds that he has gone back in time 10 years to when he started college. He has an opportunity to remake his life, starting as an arts college student. He now lives in a four-person coed share house. Kyōya has the chance to spend his formative years with creators he knows will be famous in the future, but things might not turn out as he expected.    Hirameki launched the manga in Kodansha's Suiyōbi no Sirius (Wednesday Sirius) section on the Nico Nico Seiga service in November 2018. The manga moved to Magazine Pocket in September 2019. Kodansha published the manga's sixth compiled book volume in October 2021.    Kodokawa publishes the novels in Japan. The novels ranked at #6 on the list of top light novels in Takarajimasha's Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! (This Light Novel Is Amazing!) guidebook for 2018, and the series ranked at #7 on the list for 2019.  Kadokawa published the 10th novel volume on February 22.    The novels inspired a television anime adaptation that premiered in July 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan.

Youth Time Travel Manga Ends   posted on 2022-04-05 16:47 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Bonjin Hirameki's manga based on Nachi Kio's novel series launched in 2018; novels inspired TV anime last year    Kodansha's Magazine Pocket website published the final chapter of Bonjin Hirameki's manga adaptation of author Nachi Kio and illustrator Eretto's Boku-tachi no Remake (Remake Our Life!) light novel series on Monday. The final chapter consists of two parts, which debuted on March 21 and Monday, respectively.    The story centers on the unsuccessful game director Kyōya Hashiba. His company goes bankrupt, and he ends up returning to his parents' home. He lies in bed thinking about the successful creators of his generation. When he opens his eyes, Kyōya finds that he has gone back in time 10 years to when he started college. He has an opportunity to remake his life, starting as an arts college student. He now lives in a four-person coed share house. Kyōya has the chance to spend his formative years with creators he knows will be famous in the future, but things might not turn out as he expected.    Hirameki launched the manga in Kodansha's Suiyōbi no Sirius (Wednesday Sirius) section on the Nico Nico Seiga service in November 2018. The manga moved to Magazine Pocket in September 2019. Kodansha published the manga's sixth compiled book volume in October 2021.    Kodokawa publishes the novels in Japan. The novels ranked at #6 on the list of top light novels in Takarajimasha's Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! (This Light Novel Is Amazing!) guidebook for 2018, and the series ranked at #7 on the list for 2019.  Kadokawa published the 10th novel volume on February 22.    The novels inspired a television anime adaptation that premiered in July 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

08-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/sasaki-and-miyano/episode-12/.184141,Episode 12 - Sasaki and Miyano - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

The video previews when the two main leads Yuuko and Watanuki first meet.       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.

The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.

The video previews when the two main leads Yuuko and Watanuki first meet.       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.

The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD.

Bandai Namco Partners With the Angels as It Officially Calls Southern California Home   Apr  7th 2022         Beloved Bandai Namco Brands Such as Pac-Man Set to Delight Fans at Angel Stadium; Company Also Plans Event in Irvine to Meet the Orange County Community   IRVINE, Calif. (April 6, 2022) – Bandai Namco Group today announced that it has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Angels, bringing one of the most respected entertainment companies in the world together with an iconic MLB club who has been a mainstay for baseball fans in Southern California for more than 60 years. The relationship between the Angels and Bandai Namco is a natural one, as the company with beloved brands in video games, toys, and collectibles such as PAC-MAN®, GUNDAM®, TAMAGOTCHI®, GALAGA®, and TEKKEN®, as well as the recent blockbuster title ELDEN RING™, has recently established its US headquarters in Irvine, California.   Just in time for the exciting start of the 2022 MLB season, fans who attend Angels home games will see Bandai Namco corporate and product branding, including the company's all-new logo, on fixed and rotating signage behind home plate, first and third-baseline signage, and 360-degree LED stadium signage. Bandai Namco Group will also be featured in Angels media including Angel Magazine, social media support, and live game broadcasts on AM830 KLAA, the official radio station of the Angels.  “We are thrilled to welcome Bandai Namco to the Angels Partnership Family,” said Angels Chairman, Dennis Kuhl. “With Bandai Namco moving their US headquarters to Orange County, and our shared objective of entertaining millions while supporting our local community, this is a natural fit between our brands that I know our fans will enjoy.”  “We are proud to partner with the Los Angeles Angels and support California's first MLB club as we bring our own teams together under one roof at Bandai Namco's new US headquarters in Orange County,” said Nobuhiko Momoi, President & CEO, Bandai Namco Holdings USA Inc. “It's thrilling to think that the Bandai Namco brand and signature icons such as Pac-Man, which has been delighting our fans for more than 40 years, will now help bring even more excitement to baseball fans as they sit in beautiful Angel Stadium. We invite members of the Orange County community to learn more about Bandai Namco, a company who has created and published some of the world's most recognized and adored entertainment products.”  In addition to supporting the local MLB club, Bandai Namco wants to introduce its own teams and meet the community in Irvine and Orange County. The company is organizing “Welcome to the PAC!”, an event billed as an introduction to the local community taking place May 1st at the Irvine Spectrum Center. “Welcome to the PAC!” is open to the public, inviting everyone to come participate in a day of fun family-friendly activities that include a main stage with entertainment and musical performances, tents featuring video game demos, goodies, and giveaways.

Bandai Namco Partners With the Angels as It Officially Calls Southern California Home   Apr  7th 2022         Beloved Bandai Namco Brands Such as Pac-Man Set to Delight Fans at Angel Stadium; Company Also Plans Event in Irvine to Meet the Orange County Community   IRVINE, Calif. (April 6, 2022) – Bandai Namco Group today announced that it has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Angels, bringing one of the most respected entertainment companies in the world together with an iconic MLB club who has been a mainstay for baseball fans in Southern California for more than 60 years. The relationship between the Angels and Bandai Namco is a natural one, as the company with beloved brands in video games, toys, and collectibles such as PAC-MAN®, GUNDAM®, TAMAGOTCHI®, GALAGA®, and TEKKEN®, as well as the recent blockbuster title ELDEN RING™, has recently established its US headquarters in Irvine, California.   Just in time for the exciting start of the 2022 MLB season, fans who attend Angels home games will see Bandai Namco corporate and product branding, including the company's all-new logo, on fixed and rotating signage behind home plate, first and third-baseline signage, and 360-degree LED stadium signage. Bandai Namco Group will also be featured in Angels media including Angel Magazine, social media support, and live game broadcasts on AM830 KLAA, the official radio station of the Angels.  “We are thrilled to welcome Bandai Namco to the Angels Partnership Family,” said Angels Chairman, Dennis Kuhl. “With Bandai Namco moving their US headquarters to Orange County, and our shared objective of entertaining millions while supporting our local community, this is a natural fit between our brands that I know our fans will enjoy.”  “We are proud to partner with the Los Angeles Angels and support California's first MLB club as we bring our own teams together under one roof at Bandai Namco's new US headquarters in Orange County,” said Nobuhiko Momoi, President & CEO, Bandai Namco Holdings USA Inc. “It's thrilling to think that the Bandai Namco brand and signature icons such as Pac-Man, which has been delighting our fans for more than 40 years, will now help bring even more excitement to baseball fans as they sit in beautiful Angel Stadium. We invite members of the Orange County community to learn more about Bandai Namco, a company who has created and published some of the world's most recognized and adored entertainment products.”  In addition to supporting the local MLB club, Bandai Namco wants to introduce its own teams and meet the community in Irvine and Orange County. The company is organizing “Welcome to the PAC!”, an event billed as an introduction to the local community taking place May 1st at the Irvine Spectrum Center. “Welcome to the PAC!” is open to the public, inviting everyone to come participate in a day of fun family-friendly activities that include a main stage with entertainment and musical performances, tents featuring video game demos, goodies, and giveaways. For event details about “Welcome to the PAC!” please follow us on Twitter and make sure to look for an update on April 20 at https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          158 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 158 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Bandai Namco Partners With the Angels as It Officially Calls Southern California Home   Apr  7th 2022         Beloved Bandai Namco Brands Such as Pac-Man Set to Delight Fans at Angel Stadium; Company Also Plans Event in Irvine to Meet the Orange County Community   IRVINE, Calif. (April 6, 2022) – Bandai Namco Group today announced that it has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Angels, bringing one of the most respected entertainment companies in the world together with an iconic MLB club who has been a mainstay for baseball fans in Southern California for more than 60 years. The relationship between the Angels and Bandai Namco is a natural one, as the company with beloved brands in video games, toys, and collectibles such as PAC-MAN®, GUNDAM®, TAMAGOTCHI®, GALAGA®, and TEKKEN®, as well as the recent blockbuster title ELDEN RING™, has recently established its US headquarters in Irvine, California.   Just in time for the exciting start of the 2022 MLB season, fans who attend Angels home games will see Bandai Namco corporate and product branding, including the company's all-new logo, on fixed and rotating signage behind home plate, first and third-baseline signage, and 360-degree LED stadium signage. Bandai Namco Group will also be featured in Angels media including Angel Magazine, social media support, and live game broadcasts on AM830 KLAA, the official radio station of the Angels.  “We are thrilled to welcome Bandai Namco to the Angels Partnership Family,” said Angels Chairman, Dennis Kuhl. “With Bandai Namco moving their US headquarters to Orange County, and our shared objective of entertaining millions while supporting our local community, this is a natural fit between our brands that I know our fans will enjoy.”  “We are proud to partner with the Los Angeles Angels and support California's first MLB club as we bring our own teams together under one roof at Bandai Namco's new US headquarters in Orange County,” said Nobuhiko Momoi, President & CEO, Bandai Namco Holdings USA Inc. “It's thrilling to think that the Bandai Namco brand and signature icons such as Pac-Man, which has been delighting our fans for more than 40 years, will now help bring even more excitement to baseball fans as they sit in beautiful Angel Stadium. We invite members of the Orange County community to learn more about Bandai Namco, a company who has created and published some of the world's most recognized and adored entertainment products.”  In addition to supporting the local MLB club, Bandai Namco wants to introduce its own teams and meet the community in Irvine and Orange County. The company is organizing “Welcome to the PAC!”, an event billed as an introduction to the local community taking place May 1st at the Irvine Spectrum Center. “Welcome to the PAC!” is open to the public, inviting everyone to come participate in a day of fun family-friendly activities that include a main stage with entertainment and musical performances, tents featuring video game demos, goodies, and giveaways.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.

Previous advertisements in the The New York Times had stated that the manga's 41st volume would launch in the U.S. and France in summer 2022. Dark Horse Comics has since stated that those advertisements were estimated release windows, and the actual date had to be adjusted.    The afterword in the 41st volume from Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga is still undecided. The staff also thanked its readers.    The editorial staff had stated in September that there was ""no information to share about the future"" of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga ""at this time."" The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

News Dark Horse to Publish 1st Berserk Manga Volume Since Kentarou Miura's Passing in November   posted on 2022-04-05 02:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24    Dark Horse Comics confirmed with Crunchyroll on Monday that it will release the 41st compiled book volume of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga, which includes the final chapters that Miura had created for the series, in November. The volume (English cover pictured right) will go on sale at comic stores on November 9 and in bookstores on November 22. The trade paperback release will include a two-sided color poster insert.    This was the series' first volume since Miura's passing in May, and the first in three years.    The 41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24.    Previous advertisements in the The New York Times had stated that the manga's 41st volume would launch in the U.S. and France in summer 2022. Dark Horse Comics has since stated that those advertisements were estimated release windows, and the actual date had to be adjusted.    The afterword in the 41st volume from Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga is still undecided. The staff also thanked its readers.    The editorial staff had stated in September that there was ""no information to share about the future"" of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga ""at this time."" The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

News Dark Horse to Publish 1st Berserk Manga Volume Since Kentarou Miura's Passing in November   posted on 2022-04-05 02:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24    Dark Horse Comics confirmed with Crunchyroll on Monday that it will release the 41st compiled book volume of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga, which includes the final chapters that Miura had created for the series, in November. The volume (English cover pictured right) will go on sale at comic stores on November 9 and in bookstores on November 22. The trade paperback release will include a two-sided color poster insert.    This was the series' first volume since Miura's passing in May, and the first in three years.    The 41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24.    Previous advertisements in the The New York Times had stated that the manga's 41st volume would launch in the U.S. and France in summer 2022. Dark Horse Comics has since stated that those advertisements were estimated release windows, and the actual date had to be adjusted.    The afterword in the 41st volume from Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga is still undecided. The staff also thanked its readers.    The editorial staff had stated in September that there was ""no information to share about the future"" of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga ""at this time."" The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

This was the series' first volume since Miura's passing in May, and the first in three years.    The 41st manga volume shipped in Japan on December 24.    Previous advertisements in the The New York Times had stated that the manga's 41st volume would launch in the U.S. and France in summer 2022. Dark Horse Comics has since stated that those advertisements were estimated release windows, and the actual date had to be adjusted.    The afterword in the 41st volume from Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga is still undecided. The staff also thanked its readers.    The editorial staff had stated in September that there was ""no information to share about the future"" of Kentarou Miura's Berserk manga ""at this time."" The statement added that the staff's priority will ""always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us.""    The 41st volume's release came in both regular and special editions, the latter of which includes special canvas art and a drama CD. Miura drew the canvas art (pictured left) that adorns the special edition of the 41st volume. The drama CD features the return of the anime's cast and portrays the manga's key ""Awakening"" chapter, which has never been seen in any of the manga's anime adaptations. Makoto Fukami also returned to pen the drama CD's script.    Miura passed away on May 6, 2021 due to acute aortic dissection. He was 54. Since the announcement of Miura's passing, creators in Japan and throughout the world have offered their condolences.    The Berserk manga follows Guts, a superhumanly strong warrior who wields a large sword, as he wanders a dark medieval world filled with demons, corrupt and decadent nobles, and other horrors. Every night, he is assailed by demons, attracted to the curse branded on him after a traumatic event. He makes his way through the world on a quest to slay a former friend turned demon, who took everything away from him.    Miura published the one-shot version of the Berserk manga in Hakusensha's Monthly Comicomi magazine in 1988. He launched the full Berserk manga series in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House magazine in 1989, and the series continued in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine until now. The series has over 40 million copies in circulation. Hakusensha published the manga's 40th volume in Japan on September 28, 2018. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America on October 8, 2019. Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the manga in the deluxe hardcover editions in February 2019. Each volume features three normal compiled volumes of the manga.    The manga inspired a television anime series in 1997, as well as an anime film trilogy from 2012 to 2013. Another television anime series premiered in Japan in July 2016, and the second half of the new series premiered in April 2017.

Find out whether this 1986 classic deserves a spot on your shelf. ― I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""

GN 1   Mar 31, 00:00 2 comments                 manga    The manga starts off with questionable premise (a tenant agrees to exchange sex for roof over her head) but what you'll discover beneath that façade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society. ― It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise.

I was surprised at how much love, wholesomeness, and affection could be squeezed out from such a dreary and at times lewd premise. ― Despite the rather dark implications of the overall premise, I thought it was just another entry in the growing list of anime that are now making up this “teasing genre.” Than...                    review          2 comments       Came the Mirror & Other Tales GN   Jan 19, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work. ― Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    review          8 comments       Selection Project   Jan 17, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    When it's not bogging itself down with tonal filler, Selection Project is filling the central character conflict of its reality-show story with some of the wildest plot twists I've encountered in a series like this recently. ― A crowded field like idol anime means a series needs to have its own particular identity to stand out, and Selection Project's approach seems to be to pitch itself as at least ...                    review          3 comments       Shikizakura Episodes 1-12   Jan 16, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    As far as what it's playing with in terms of influence and genre stylings, Shikizakura is tokusatsu as all heck. ― Tokusatsu has enjoyed a run of increased availability and visibility among English-speaking audiences, particularly those adjacent to anime fan circles, for a good several years now. It's to the point where many more people than before have an idea of what tokusatsu 'is' (or at least the...                    review          7 comments       Farewell, My Dear Cramer   Jan  5, 01:00 7 comments                 anime    Farewell, My Dear Cramer, with its themes of how neglected women's soccer has become compared to its male equivalent, ironically received such a poor production that it actively hampered its ability to tell its story for much of its run. ― I cannot begin to describe how excited I was for Farewell, My Dear Cramer at first.

It's a 'Man Versus Wild' situation if said Wild also had goblins in it. ― Alright, another new isekai, what's the deal with this one?

For Dai it was probably scheduled to end at the end of the summer season. Will they be able to get more space for it in the fall season broadcast schedule? Will they have to cut and speed up things to finish the story in time? The original schedule had a recap episode planned so it will be interesting to see if that episode still happens or not.

I don't see Dai getting too affected but I do see Delicious Party Precure getting the latter treatment since it happened with the Precure-before last when everything went on hiatus for months due to the pandemic.

For Dai it was probably scheduled to end at the end of the summer season. Will they be able to get more space for it in the fall season broadcast schedule? Will they have to cut and speed up things to finish the story in time? The original schedule had a recap episode planned so it will be interesting to see if that episode still happens or not.

For Dai it was probably scheduled to end at the end of the summer season. Will they be able to get more space for it in the fall season broadcast schedule? Will they have to cut and speed up things to finish the story in time? The original schedule had a recap episode planned so it will be interesting to see if that episode still happens or not.

Digimon will also be debuting the new ED theme on this episode, which is a few episodes earlier than usual. The delay must have forced them to debut it earlier.
