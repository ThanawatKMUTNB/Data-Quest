Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan.

Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative.

As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

08-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-quest/the-adventure-of-dai/voiume-1/.183737,Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai GN 1 - Review - Anime News Network:SEA,"  Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          158 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 158 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          158 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 158 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          158 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 158 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          158 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 158 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him.

She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space.

Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.

She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school.

Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.

Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.

08-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aharen-san-wa-hakarenai/.183505,Aharen-san wa Hakarenai - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way.

For starters, “lolicon” or “roricon” is short for “Lolita Complex.” “Lolita” as a term for an under-age girl comes from the book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.

Justin looks back on old video rooms and industry panels to find out. ―  Fred asked: I've only been going to conventions for the past year or so, and I'm curious how they've evolved over time.
