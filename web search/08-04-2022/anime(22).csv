How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST.

Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList.

Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012.

It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show.

Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012.

And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation.

Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds.

Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag.

After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community.

This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime.

And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami.

It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools.

How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke?

It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.   ",positive,en,{}
08-04-2022,anime,29,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-01/how-an-april-fools-day-joke-revived-toonami/.184015,How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami - Anime News Network:SEA,"   By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have.

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.

And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life.

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?

Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad.

With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work.

It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era.

After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice.

Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?

Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing.

And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life.

Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice.

The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans! As the ancient scribe once said, ""People called Romanes, they go the houses!""      ",positive,en,{}

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one.

It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans! As the ancient scribe once said, ""People called Romanes, they go the houses!""     ",positive,en,{}

It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one.

Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.    ",positive,en,{}

The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.   ",positive,en,{}

Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 16, 01:30 76 comments                 anime    This week's episode is the start of both the emotional and action climax for the entire series—and boy does it work.                    ep. review          144 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 16, 00:30 144 comments                 anime    This week, Souma addresses a basic need for his people and our reviewer actually found himself in agreement with his decisions!                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 85   Mar 15, 07:30 168 comments                 anime    These two really do not want to have to kill their friends if they don't have to, and they might just manage to get their hands on the plane they need if Floch doesn't stop to think too hard about Armin's improvised distraction.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 06:30 42 comments                 anime    The Battle of Barnet is over. The Battle of Tewkesbury looms. Richard's battle with himself is in full swing, and I don't think that angel on his shoulder is gone for good.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 05:30 31 comments                 anime    The Monster Development Department gets meta as the the would-be villains suit up for the beach.                    ep. review          108 comments       86 Season 2 ‒ Episode 22   Mar 15, 04:30 108 comments                 anime    If anything, the 3-month gap between Episodes 21 and 22 has proven how much can be achieved with that extra time to think.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    If Kitagawa can understand Gojo's discomfort, I don't see why the rest of us can't do the same for others and I wish more people in the anime community take that into consideration.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 02:30 101 comments                 anime    The UW's ultimate goal appears to be a world completely cleansed of the Y chromosome. I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 04:30 76 comments                 anime    This is the point of no return for Karyl. Up until now, she has been able to play both sides to an extent.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    I love how this episode explores cosplaying on a budget from repurposing everyday clothing to finding solutions to costume malfunctions.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1013   Mar  9, 01:30 621 comments                 anime    While the episode has a brief recap of Sanji's literal thirst trap scenario and Jinbei's soon-to-be-epic showdown, the real meat is in the Yamato and Ace interactions.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 23:30 81 comments                 anime    For anyone that has lived in Japan, this episode conjures up a certain nostalgia for roaming department stores and munching on food court karaage.                    ep. review          144 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 22:30 144 comments                 anime    Any time a work deals with the topic of slavery, you know it's entering into touchy territory. Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas. Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 16, 01:30 76 comments                 anime    This week's episode is the start of both the emotional and action climax for the entire series—and boy does it work.                    ep. review          144 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 16, 00:30 144 comments                 anime    This week, Souma addresses a basic need for his people and our reviewer actually found himself in agreement with his decisions!                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 85   Mar 15, 07:30 168 comments                 anime    These two really do not want to have to kill their friends if they don't have to, and they might just manage to get their hands on the plane they need if Floch doesn't stop to think too hard about Armin's improvised distraction.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 06:30 42 comments                 anime    The Battle of Barnet is over. The Battle of Tewkesbury looms. Richard's battle with himself is in full swing, and I don't think that angel on his shoulder is gone for good.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 05:30 31 comments                 anime    The Monster Development Department gets meta as the the would-be villains suit up for the beach.                    ep. review          108 comments       86 Season 2 ‒ Episode 22   Mar 15, 04:30 108 comments                 anime    If anything, the 3-month gap between Episodes 21 and 22 has proven how much can be achieved with that extra time to think.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    If Kitagawa can understand Gojo's discomfort, I don't see why the rest of us can't do the same for others and I wish more people in the anime community take that into consideration.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 02:30 101 comments                 anime    The UW's ultimate goal appears to be a world completely cleansed of the Y chromosome. I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 04:30 76 comments                 anime    This is the point of no return for Karyl. Up until now, she has been able to play both sides to an extent.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    I love how this episode explores cosplaying on a budget from repurposing everyday clothing to finding solutions to costume malfunctions.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1013   Mar  9, 01:30 621 comments                 anime    While the episode has a brief recap of Sanji's literal thirst trap scenario and Jinbei's soon-to-be-epic showdown, the real meat is in the Yamato and Ace interactions.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 23:30 81 comments                 anime    For anyone that has lived in Japan, this episode conjures up a certain nostalgia for roaming department stores and munching on food court karaage.                    ep. review          144 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 22:30 144 comments                 anime    Any time a work deals with the topic of slavery, you know it's entering into touchy territory. Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas. Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you.

I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 04:30 76 comments                 anime    This is the point of no return for Karyl. Up until now, she has been able to play both sides to an extent.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    I love how this episode explores cosplaying on a budget from repurposing everyday clothing to finding solutions to costume malfunctions.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1013   Mar  9, 01:30 621 comments                 anime    While the episode has a brief recap of Sanji's literal thirst trap scenario and Jinbei's soon-to-be-epic showdown, the real meat is in the Yamato and Ace interactions.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 23:30 81 comments                 anime    For anyone that has lived in Japan, this episode conjures up a certain nostalgia for roaming department stores and munching on food court karaage.                    ep. review          144 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 22:30 144 comments                 anime    Any time a work deals with the topic of slavery, you know it's entering into touchy territory. Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas. Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas. Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode. It's subtle, almost mundane, yet is the cream of slice of life this season because of the emotionality of Komichi's world.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 00:30 47 comments                 anime    Eri reveals her big plot and what set her on the path of villainy this week.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ SERIES FINALE   Mar 25, 23:30 107 comments                 anime    Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 03:30 18 comments                 anime    Slow Loop brings us a Koi-centric episode that's all about reminiscing while in the moment.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 02:30 19 comments                 anime    Our lord and savior Lord Ojiro is ready to make an appearance after definitely doing a murder, but first, it Minato Tribe must be deemed worthy enough to face off against our bemasked liege.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 01:30 48 comments                 anime    Now that Vizzd and Maid-chan have dropped the act and revealed their evil intentions, I'm glad to report they're just as funny – and stupid – as our heroes.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 10   Mar 25, 00:30 14 comments                 anime    At this point you don't need me to keep coming in and telling you that Tokyo 24th Ward's sociopolitical analyses are as fundamentally broken as the corpse-powered computer at the center of its narrative.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    The season's climactic battle against the reanimated and Kurokawa-possessed Tetsujin continues into its second week, with both predictable and surprising developments.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 00:30 89 comments                 anime    Now that we're in the middle of the final arc of the season, we get introduced to another flaw of our titular genius prince: his lack of experience.                    ep. review          144 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 23, 01:30 144 comments                 anime    How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom addresses a refugee crisis and childbirth in one episode with mixed results.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy.

The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty.

Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?

At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.
