Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say.

However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.  ",positive,en,{}

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform. When they're not writing and reviewing, you can find them on their  Twitter or on their  Instagram where she's always up to something.   <prevEpisode 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episodes 6-7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (19 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Tribe Nine Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform.

I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.

Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.     James is a writer with many thoughts and feelings about anime and other pop-culture, which can also be found on Twitter, his blog, and  his podcast.   <prevEpisodes 76-77 Episode 78 Episode 79 Episode 80 Episode 81 Episode 82 Episode 83 Episode 84 Episode 85 Episode 86 Episode 87     discuss this in the forum (168 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Community score: 4.3             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time.

James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.

Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength.

Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.   ",positive,en,{}
08-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/the-executioner-and-her-way-of-life/.183507,The Executioner and Her Way of Life - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

News Made in Abyss 3D Action RPG Launches in English This Fall   posted on 2022-04-05 23:21 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness launches for PS4, Switch, Steam     Spike Chunsoft began streaming an announcement video on Monday for Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness (Made in Abyss: Yami o Mezashita Rensei), its new 3D action RPG for the Made in Abyss franchise. The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in fall 2022.      The game will have an original story supervised by Akihito Tsukushi and will be available in both English and Japanese (with  fully voiced event scenes). Numskull Games is publishing the physical version in Europe.    Spike Chunsoft describes the story:  The story begins with Riko and Reg's meeting in the first episode of season one. This marks the start of their great adventure, and together they travel to Seeker Camp in the second layer of the Abyss. Experience the awesome power of the Curse of the Abyss, as well as the astonishing, legendary entities known as primeval creatures. Prepare to glimpse the world of Riko and her friends.  The game will also feature a ""story mode"" that follows the storyline of the anime adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga. The physical version of the game will also be available in a Collector's Edition that will include merchandise from the franchise.    Akihito Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Takeshobo published the 10th compiled book volume in July 2021. Seven Seas published the ninth volume in English in March 2020 and will ship the 10th volume on May 3.    The second season of the television anime will premiere in July.    The first 13-episode television anime series based on the manga premiered in Japan in July 2017.  The English-subtitled version of the show streamed in the United States on Amazon's Anime Strike service, and HIDIVE streamed the series outside of the United States.     The first compilation film for the anime, Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn (Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake), opened in Japan in January 2019, followed by the second film, Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight (Made in Abyss: Hōrō Suru Tasogare), two weeks later. Sentai Filmworks premiered the first film in Los Angeles in March 2019, before it opened in theaters later that month. Sentai Filmworks premiered the second film in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2019, before it opened in theaters in the United States later that month.     Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul, a sequel film to the first season, opened in Japan in January 2020.  Sentai Filmworks premiered the movie in select theaters in the U.S. and Canada in August 2020. Sentai Filmworks again screened the film virtually in September 2020, and HIDIVE will begin streaming the film on June 28.    Sony's Columbia Pictures has ordered a feature film script of the manga from writer and director Kevin McMullin. Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment and Mobius Productions' Masi Oka (Heroes' Hiro Nakamura actor, Outer Wilds game) are producing the project, after previously collaborating on the 2017 Death Note film (as well as its planned sequel) and the live-action The Promised Neverland series in development at Amazon.

News Bubble Anime Film's Trailer Highlights Story   posted on 2022-04-07 08:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film debuts worldwide on Netflix on April 28, opens in Japanese theaters on MAy 13    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming a new trailer on Thursday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. The trailer introduces the film's story, focusing on the song that only Hibiki and Uta can hear.         Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Eve performs the newly created opening theme song ""Bubble feat. Uta.""    Singer-songwriter Riria. performs the ending theme song ""Jaa ne, Mata ne."" (See You, Catch You Later.) ""Riria."" (written with a period.) gained fans when she began posting songs on TikTok and YouTube without revealing her face in the fall of 2019, and she has since garnered over 1.7 million followers across several social media platforms. She is not only singing the ending theme song but also voicing the heroine Uta. This is the first voice-acting role for Rina., who was personally requested by director Tetsuro Araki and producer Genki Kawamura.     The characters in the top row (left to right) in the visual above include protagonists Hibiki (Jun Shison) and Uta (Riria.), the scientist Makoto (Alice Hirose), and Shin (Mamoru Miyano). The characters in the bottom row (left to right) include Kai (Yuuki Kaji), Usagi (Sayaka Senbongi), the leader of Denki Ninja (Tasuku Hatanaka), the leader of Undertaker (Marina Inoue), and the leader of Kantō Mad Lobster (Shinichiro Miki).    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    In 2018, Netfix announced a comprehensive business alliance with Production I.G and BONES on Wednesday. The alliance includes both Production I.G and its sister anime studio in the IG Port group, Wit Studio. Wit Studio is also producing the original anime Vampire in the Garden, which will debut in Netflix on May 16.    Sources: Warner Bros.

News Bubble Anime Film's Trailer Highlights Story   posted on 2022-04-07 08:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film debuts worldwide on Netflix on April 28, opens in Japanese theaters on MAy 13    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming a new trailer on Thursday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. The trailer introduces the film's story, focusing on the song that only Hibiki and Uta can hear.         Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Eve performs the newly created opening theme song ""Bubble feat. Uta.""    Singer-songwriter Riria. performs the ending theme song ""Jaa ne, Mata ne."" (See You, Catch You Later.) ""Riria."" (written with a period.) gained fans when she began posting songs on TikTok and YouTube without revealing her face in the fall of 2019, and she has since garnered over 1.7 million followers across several social media platforms. She is not only singing the ending theme song but also voicing the heroine Uta. This is the first voice-acting role for Rina., who was personally requested by director Tetsuro Araki and producer Genki Kawamura.     The characters in the top row (left to right) in the visual above include protagonists Hibiki (Jun Shison) and Uta (Riria.), the scientist Makoto (Alice Hirose), and Shin (Mamoru Miyano). The characters in the bottom row (left to right) include Kai (Yuuki Kaji), Usagi (Sayaka Senbongi), the leader of Denki Ninja (Tasuku Hatanaka), the leader of Undertaker (Marina Inoue), and the leader of Kantō Mad Lobster (Shinichiro Miki).    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo.

But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude.

Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].
