The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but that's only the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language its hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of charming and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys, she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endless on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but that's only the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language its hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of charming and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys, she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endless on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of charming and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys, she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endless on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but that's only the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language its hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward.

I wouldn't be surprised. Crunchyroll now has access to ""in-house"" dubbing via Funimation, so it makes sense.

The Funimation name is being pretty much done away with entirely. Even the new ADR studio building Funimation has been slowly moving into the past couple years or so recently changed all the branding/signage in the building to include more orange and use ""Crunchyroll.""   I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

I also agree with what you had to say. Regardless, hopefully things will continue to work out in regards to the dubs and home video release.

It has happened twice....), it does make me sad to see the brand disappear with each action.

Have I mentioned I hate Crunchyroll lately? I have? Too bad, they're still hot garbage.   Funimation succeeded itself into non existence.            Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

I wouldn't be surprised. Crunchyroll now has access to ""in-house"" dubbing via Funimation, so it makes sense.

The Funimation name is being pretty much done away with entirely. Even the new ADR studio building Funimation has been slowly moving into the past couple years or so recently changed all the branding/signage in the building to include more orange and use ""Crunchyroll.""   I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

The Funimation name is being pretty much done away with entirely. Even the new ADR studio building Funimation has been slowly moving into the past couple years or so recently changed all the branding/signage in the building to include more orange and use ""Crunchyroll.""   I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience.

To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.            Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

The Funimation name is being pretty much done away with entirely. Even the new ADR studio building Funimation has been slowly moving into the past couple years or so recently changed all the branding/signage in the building to include more orange and use ""Crunchyroll.""   I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

I wouldn't be surprised. Crunchyroll now has access to ""in-house"" dubbing via Funimation, so it makes sense.

The Funimation name is being pretty much done away with entirely. Even the new ADR studio building Funimation has been slowly moving into the past couple years or so recently changed all the branding/signage in the building to include more orange and use ""Crunchyroll.""   I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

News Ultraman Anime Season 2 Streams Opening Animation Sequence   posted on 2022-04-07 18:48 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Sequel premieres next Thursday with opening song by NOILION    Netflix and Tsuburaya Productions posted the opening animation sequence (without superimposed credits) for the second anime season based on Eiichi Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi's Ultraman manga on Thursday. The creator unit NOILION performs the anime's opening theme song ""3.""      The anime will debut on Netflix worldwide on April 14. The new season's first episode will get an advanced screening at the ""Ultraman World Premiere and Orchestra Concert"" event on April 10.    Maaya Sakamoto plays Izumi, a journalist and Kotaro Higashi's love interest. Additionally, Junichi Suwabe voices Alien Pedanto in the anime. Ayane Sakura voices the character Maya, a Wadoran alien.    Netflix describes the anime's story:  Several years have passed since the events of Ultraman, with the legendary ""Giant of Light"" (光の巨人 Hikari no Kyojin) now a memory, as it is believed he returned home after fighting the many giant aliens that invaded the Earth. Shin Hayata's son Shinjiro seems to possess a strange ability, and it is this ability, along with his father's revelation that he was Ultraman, that leads Shinjiro to battle the new aliens invading the Earth as the new Ultraman.  The first anime season premiered globally on Netflix in April 2019 and has 13 episodes. The series then premiered on television in Japan in April 2020. Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Harlock: Space Pirate, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) directed the first anime season. Production I.G (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Sola Digital Arts (Appleseed Alpha, Starship Troopers: Invasion, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) produced the anime in 3D CG. Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi composed the music.    Kamiyama, Aramaki, Production I.G, and Sola Digital Arts are returning from the first season for the second one.    Tatsuhisa Suzuki was slated to play the new Ultraman character Kōtarō Higashi/Ultraman Taro  in the second season, but he offered to step down from the role, due to his recent hiatus from ""all entertainment industry activities"" last year. Tomoaki Maeno will voice the character instead. Suzuki performed the opening theme songs for the first season as a member of OLDCODEX.

News Ultraman Anime Season 2 Streams Opening Animation Sequence   posted on 2022-04-07 18:48 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Sequel premieres next Thursday with opening song by NOILION    Netflix and Tsuburaya Productions posted the opening animation sequence (without superimposed credits) for the second anime season based on Eiichi Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi's Ultraman manga on Thursday. The creator unit NOILION performs the anime's opening theme song ""3.""      The anime will debut on Netflix worldwide on April 14. The new season's first episode will get an advanced screening at the ""Ultraman World Premiere and Orchestra Concert"" event on April 10.    Maaya Sakamoto plays Izumi, a journalist and Kotaro Higashi's love interest. Additionally, Junichi Suwabe voices Alien Pedanto in the anime. Ayane Sakura voices the character Maya, a Wadoran alien.    Netflix describes the anime's story:  Several years have passed since the events of Ultraman, with the legendary ""Giant of Light"" (光の巨人 Hikari no Kyojin) now a memory, as it is believed he returned home after fighting the many giant aliens that invaded the Earth. Shin Hayata's son Shinjiro seems to possess a strange ability, and it is this ability, along with his father's revelation that he was Ultraman, that leads Shinjiro to battle the new aliens invading the Earth as the new Ultraman.  The first anime season premiered globally on Netflix in April 2019 and has 13 episodes. The series then premiered on television in Japan in April 2020. Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Harlock: Space Pirate, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) directed the first anime season. Production I.G (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Sola Digital Arts (Appleseed Alpha, Starship Troopers: Invasion, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) produced the anime in 3D CG. Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi composed the music.    Kamiyama, Aramaki, Production I.G, and Sola Digital Arts are returning from the first season for the second one.    Tatsuhisa Suzuki was slated to play the new Ultraman character Kōtarō Higashi/Ultraman Taro  in the second season, but he offered to step down from the role, due to his recent hiatus from ""all entertainment industry activities"" last year. Tomoaki Maeno will voice the character instead. Suzuki performed the opening theme songs for the first season as a member of OLDCODEX.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3890       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).   This show sure is lucky it doesn't air on the weekend, or I wouldn't have bothered with it.

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3890       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3890       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi.""

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3890       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.

Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.

Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}
08-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already.

I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.
