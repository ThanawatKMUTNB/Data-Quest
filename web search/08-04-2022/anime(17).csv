The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here.

It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic.

Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (154 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together.

It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course.

08-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/birdie-wing-golf-girls-story/.183522,Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.  ",positive,en,{}

News Witch Hat Atelier Manga Gets Anime   posted on 2022-04-05 23:36 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Teaser video, commemorative art unveiled    The official website of Kodansha's Morning two magazine announced on Tuesday that Kamome Shirahama's Witch Hat Atelier manga is getting an anime adaptation. A special website opened and unveiled a teaser video:       Shirahama drew an illustration to commemorate the anime's announcement:     The website will reveal more details including the broadcast premiere at a later date.    The manga's story centers on Koko, a girl who lives in a little village, and who has always dreamed of becoming a wizard. But being born without magical aptitude meant that she could never become a wizard, and could never hope to witness magic's spark. She gave up on her dream. But one day, a traveling wizard named Kiefley came to her village, and she happened to see him performing magic.    Shirahama launched the manga in Morning two in July 2016. Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.    The manga has over 2.5 million copies in circulation worldwide.    The series was nominated for the Best Comic award at Angoulême International Comics Festival in January 2019. The manga was also nominated for the 11th Manga Taisho awards in 2018. The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook. The manga ranked on American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens list in 2020. The series won Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in October 2020.

News Witch Hat Atelier Manga Gets Anime   posted on 2022-04-05 23:36 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Teaser video, commemorative art unveiled    The official website of Kodansha's Morning two magazine announced on Tuesday that Kamome Shirahama's Witch Hat Atelier manga is getting an anime adaptation. A special website opened and unveiled a teaser video:       Shirahama drew an illustration to commemorate the anime's announcement:     The website will reveal more details including the broadcast premiere at a later date.    The manga's story centers on Koko, a girl who lives in a little village, and who has always dreamed of becoming a wizard. But being born without magical aptitude meant that she could never become a wizard, and could never hope to witness magic's spark. She gave up on her dream. But one day, a traveling wizard named Kiefley came to her village, and she happened to see him performing magic.    Shirahama launched the manga in Morning two in July 2016. Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.    The manga has over 2.5 million copies in circulation worldwide.    The series was nominated for the Best Comic award at Angoulême International Comics Festival in January 2019. The manga was also nominated for the 11th Manga Taisho awards in 2018. The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook. The manga ranked on American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens list in 2020. The series won Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in October 2020.

Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.

The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.

The channel will continue to stream anime clips, trailers, and full episodes of English-dubbed anime. The channel will also post a dubbed first episode every Saturday at 3:00 p.m. ET, starting with Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- on April 9.    Crunchyroll streams English-subtitled trailers and content on its ""Crunchyroll Collections"" YouTube channel.    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.    Funimation's home video releases are also becoming listed under Crunchyroll.    Crunchyroll and Funimation first announced the acquisition in December 2020 with a purchase price of US$1.175 billion. The technology website The Information reported in August 2020 that AT&T offered Crunchyroll to Sony for US$1.5 billion and that Sony reportedly ""balked at"" the price, which effectively valued the streaming service at US$500 per subscriber. Entertainment news source Variety reported that AT&T was shopping the company to multiple potential buyers aside from Sony Pictures Entertainment at that time. Nikkei Asia later reported that October that Sony was in final negotiations for the Crunchyroll acquisition. At that time, the newspaper reported that Sony ""could end up spending more than 100 billion yen ($957 million).""

Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.    Funimation's home video releases are also becoming listed under Crunchyroll.    Crunchyroll and Funimation first announced the acquisition in December 2020 with a purchase price of US$1.175 billion. The technology website The Information reported in August 2020 that AT&T offered Crunchyroll to Sony for US$1.5 billion and that Sony reportedly ""balked at"" the price, which effectively valued the streaming service at US$500 per subscriber. Entertainment news source Variety reported that AT&T was shopping the company to multiple potential buyers aside from Sony Pictures Entertainment at that time. Nikkei Asia later reported that October that Sony was in final negotiations for the Crunchyroll acquisition.

Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.

Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

Interest hololive's Mori Calliope To Make Major Label Debut, Hold Solo Concert   posted on 2022-04-07 01:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           Cover Corporation announced on Twitter on Monday that hololive Virtual YouTuber Mori Calliope will make her major-label debut under the Universal Music sublabel EMI Records with the release of her first EP ""SHINIGAMI NOTE"" on July 20.       Furthermore, a day after the release on July 21, Calliope will hold a live solo concert titled ""New Underworld Order - Mori Calliope Major Debut Concert"" at Tokyo's Toyosu PIT.    ""SHINIGAMI NOTE"" will contain 6 new songs, including ""CapSule"" by Calliope and hololive VTuber Suisei Hoshimachi (composed by Vocaloid composer DECO*27). You can check out the music video for ""CapSule"" below:      If you're a Dead Beat (Calliope's affectionate term for her fans), you might also want to get your hands on the first-press limited edition LP-sized version of ""SHINIGAMI NOTE,"" which is available for 6,600 yen (around US$53) including tax. Aside from the CD, this limited-edition release also includes a DVD containing a 30-minute behind-the-scenes interview with Calliope, five original LP-sized cover jackets drawn by various artists, and most importantly, a crest badge to prove that you're a member of Dead Beats. Both the standard and limited-edition versions of the EP are available for pre-order here.    Mori Calliope debuted as part of the hololive English branch in September 2020. She is the first hololive English talent to make a major-label debut.

""SHINIGAMI NOTE"" will contain 6 new songs, including ""CapSule"" by Calliope and hololive VTuber Suisei Hoshimachi (composed by Vocaloid composer DECO*27). You can check out the music video for ""CapSule"" below:      If you're a Dead Beat (Calliope's affectionate term for her fans), you might also want to get your hands on the first-press limited edition LP-sized version of ""SHINIGAMI NOTE,"" which is available for 6,600 yen (around US$53) including tax. Aside from the CD, this limited-edition release also includes a DVD containing a 30-minute behind-the-scenes interview with Calliope, five original LP-sized cover jackets drawn by various artists, and most importantly, a crest badge to prove that you're a member of Dead Beats. Both the standard and limited-edition versions of the EP are available for pre-order here.    Mori Calliope debuted as part of the hololive English branch in September 2020. She is the first hololive English talent to make a major-label debut.

Yen Press publishes both the original light novels and Akio Hiiragi's manga adaptation, and it describes the story:    After being soundly thrashed by the hero Emilia, the Devil King and his general beat a hasty retreat to a parallel universe... only to land plop in the middle of bustling, modern-day Tokyo! Lacking the magic necessary to return home, the two are forced to assume human identities and live average human lives until they can find a better solution. And to make ends meet, Satan finds gainful employment at a nearby fast food joint! With his devilish mind set on working his way up the management food chain, what will become of his thirst for conquest?!   Wagahara launched the light novels with illustrations by 029 in 2011. Hiiragi's manga adaptation launched in Kadokawa's Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh magazine in December 2011. Kurone Mishima drew another manga spinoff called Hataraku Maou-sama! High School! in Kadokawa's Dengeki Maoh magazine from 2012 to 2015. Yen Press also published all five volumes of the manga.

(with two exclamation points), the second anime season based on Satoshi Wagahara's The Devil is a Part-Timer! light novel series, announced on Tuesday that Minami Kuribayashi is returning to perform the new season's opening theme song ""WITH.""    Kuribayashi's single for ""WITH"" launches on July 20. She performed the opening theme song ""ZERO!!"" for the anime's first season.    The anime will debut in July 2022.    Daisuke Tsukushi (Isekai Cheat Magician, Girl Friend Note) and Studio 3Hz are replacing Naoto Hosoda and White Fox on the new season.  Masahiro Yokotani,  Ryosuke Nakanishi, Akemi Tejima (Wish), Jin Aketagawa, and Lantis are returning as the series script supervisor, musical composer, color key artist, and music production company respectively.

The other new staff members include:    Design Works: Ryou Akizuki  Graphic Art: Hirofumi Araki  Art Director: Manabu Otsuzuki (Kusanagi) Art Setting: Hideyasu Narita (Kusanagi) Compositing Director of Photography: Ryō Iijima (Asahi Production) 3D Director: Kōhei Ogawa (Marco) Editing: Hidemitsu Doi  Special Effects: Kei Ishibashi (Asahi Production) Produce: Infinite   The returning cast members include:     Ryota Ohsaka as Sadao Maō/Demon King Satan   Yōko Hikasa as Emi Yusa/Heroine Emilia   Nao Tōyama as Chiho Sasaki   Yūki Ono as Shirō Ashiya/Demon General Alciel   Hiro Shimono as Hanzō Urushihara/Demon General Lucifer   Kanae Itō as Suzuno Kamazuki    Hina Kino will play Alas Ramus, a mysterious little girl born from an apple.

Yen Press publishes both the original light novels and Akio Hiiragi's manga adaptation, and it describes the story:    After being soundly thrashed by the hero Emilia, the Devil King and his general beat a hasty retreat to a parallel universe... only to land plop in the middle of bustling, modern-day Tokyo! Lacking the magic necessary to return home, the two are forced to assume human identities and live average human lives until they can find a better solution. And to make ends meet, Satan finds gainful employment at a nearby fast food joint! With his devilish mind set on working his way up the management food chain, what will become of his thirst for conquest?!   Wagahara launched the light novels with illustrations by 029 in 2011. Hiiragi's manga adaptation launched in Kadokawa's Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh magazine in December 2011. Kurone Mishima drew another manga spinoff called Hataraku Maou-sama! High School! in Kadokawa's Dengeki Maoh magazine from 2012 to 2015. Yen Press also published all five volumes of the manga.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

For eventually in later light novel volumes according to certain people, spoiler[ both of them become a couple when the saint of the empire also become souma's 4th royal wife]    though how did that end up occuring is anyone's guess!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Do you enjoy isekai shows where the the protaganist is OP and everything they do requires almost zero effort like so many of the isekai animes out there? we all enjoy a struggle but a believable struggle is hard. Honestly I don't think the whole premise of this season has reveled itself.

I believe the author of the light novel must have study the history of political science and then they decided to pull a Zipang or ""The Final Countdown"" and says here's what might happen if you go back in time with all the current knowledge.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

For eventually in later light novel volumes according to certain people, spoiler[ both of them become a couple when the saint of the empire also become souma's 4th royal wife]    though how did that end up occuring is anyone's guess!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

I tend to agree, especially after Ep18 where the book is heavily quoted as if it were the Bible for politics. There have been no shortage of treatises on government and politics in history but the author doesn't even mention one other....

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

I was thinking the same, you don't just kill 10 (?) heads of powerful families ostensibly friendly and expect the repercussions won't be massive. Historical precedent for that sort of thing shows the bloodshed can go on for centuries! Not too smart a move..

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

I was thinking the same, you don't just kill 10 (?) heads of powerful families ostensibly friendly and expect the repercussions won't be massive. Historical precedent for that sort of thing shows the bloodshed can go on for centuries! Not too smart a move..

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

I kind of want to see a political ruler that can actually give Souma a good run for his money, because Julius will probably fall apart while he's in charge.    Jeanne is really growing on me (and her sister definitely seems interested in Souma). I wonder where the story with the Demon Lord will go.    I love Liscia's jealous moments, getting antsy with Jeanne wanting to steal Souma away or Aisha getting competitive.

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!

Political Science is not genre for a shonen anime.            i wouldnt go that far.    there is a big difference between realist hero & zipang!    especially considering that when it comes to the styles of their respected authors, its more than clear that they were more influenced  by different things. hero's author feels like he was influenced by spice and wolf & bookworm from how the story is skowly developing wheras zipang's author is clearly influenced by childhood IRL stuff!

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

I don't see that ending well.            well thats an understatement. also they showed that scene with the prime minister in black and the empire's knight princess FOR A REASON!    For eventually in later light novel volumes according to certain people, spoiler[ both of them become a couple when the saint of the empire also become souma's 4th royal wife]    though how did that end up occuring is anyone's guess!

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.            I disagree with you breakdown. I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE DEATH FLAG if that was the case!

I was thinking the same, you don't just kill 10 (?) heads of powerful families ostensibly friendly and expect the repercussions won't be massive. Historical precedent for that sort of thing shows the bloodshed can go on for centuries! Not too smart a move..

THAT was not the reason she did that. it was because that souma is using their tech and adapt them similarily to how he lived in our world of science!    like for example, using the broadcast gemstones as entertainment and informing the public, but it was his idea of using the frequency to their individual gemstones to where he and the saint of the empire can exclusively commune in private and says its commonplace in our world is what set jeanne off and made her suggest that he marries her sister for she WANTED to see what kind of empire those two would have been able to create if he had accepted!   regardless, it may be slow now but from those trailers and opening showed (the amadonia princess basically joining souma's harem as well as the death of a certain character), its going to be quite intersting later on in the series!   and we can thank J.C STAFF for a season 2 for if it was produced by kadokawa animation, its more likely this series would have gotten the ""BUY THE SOURCE MATERIALS"" type of ending at the end of ep 12-13 ala trinity seven and other series that got produced by kadokawa that unfortunately ended up getting the dreaded ""READ THE BOOKS, KIDS!"" endings since their light novels aka the source materials arent one of those insanely popular light novels ala the irregular at magic high school , that time i was reincarnated into a slime or jobless reincarnation to warrant a new season!

Liscia must be really internalizing how much Carmine's fate is eating away at her.    Jeanne and Hakuya seem pretty chummy.    I wasn't expecting a commendation ceremony to turn into Aisha's dad pimping his daughter out as Souma's next queen or Juna making her play, but Liscia is at least ready to approve sister wives that she knows as long as she is the undisputed first wife/queen. Too bad Juna has to wait until she's Nana Mizuki level to get married to Souma in public.   A secret cabal conspiring against Souma? I don't see that ending well.

The writing priorities of this show are the same as stuff like the currently airing The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest or other stuff like Isekai Smartphone. Everything this show does is to make the main character look cool. The smart people know how cool and smart Souma is so they want to ally with him. The dumb people like the prince are the ones that oppose our protag and refuse to see how cool he is. The entire setting itself seems to have elements made of stupid so that our protag can point it out and look smart for doing so.   However The Strongest Sage thingy and Isekai Smartphone seem to know how making a story purely about ""look at how awesome our protag is"" is kinda silly and not fit for a story to be taken seriously so they just take a lighthearted tone and don't try to overthink it. OP protag solving problems without effort makes for a bit lame entertainment but it is what it is, good for some brainless lighthearted fun. Realist Hero tries to be like a political thriller but just mixed with an Light Novel OP protagonist. You know, it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Without the thrill, all this political intrigue seems like a wasted effort.            It seems to be a trend in Light Novels recently majority of Isekai seem to be centered on 3 categories.   First one, as described above overpowered hero who ends up with Harem, most of them are male dominated with a female one thrown in from time to time:  Arifuta, Realist Hero, Reincarnated as a Slime, Isekai smartphone, cheat magician, she called herself pupil of wise man, how not to summon demon lord, moon-led journey, shield hero, so I am a Spider. There is a new one coming up - life is hard for MOB in Otome world. (There is a sub-genre of it that uses reincarnation instead of isekai but everything else is the same: I wanted to be average in my next life, misfit in demon king academy, strongest sage with weakest seal).   Second one is overpowered hero isekai to fantasy world but wants to live in peace or pursue slow life. Majority of that is female dominated with couple of male ones thrown in.  Killing slimes for 300 years,  Ascendance Of A Bookworm, Saint's power is omnipotent,  drugstore in another world.   Third variation is average japanese girl/boy isekai into villain of the novel/game just read/played and need to get out of bad end. Korean web novels are consumed with this one and mostly dominated by females as MC. My next life as a villainess seem to be a starting point of it, Overlord is variation for male MC.   Tanya the Evil and So I am a Spider seems to be a different sub-genre as its written from point of view of a villain(ess) but who consideres himself (herself) a hero. Forget about  redo of healer which is basically revenge porn.

I would categorize Isekai on a sliding scale with the 2 ends and then everything in between could be sub categorized further. I would put isekal's into light and dark. ""light isekai"" on the far left of my scale would breakdown into ""Overpowered and Everything is easy"" (Smart Phone, Weakest Crest, Cheat Magician, etc). Then I would go with ""Protag is powerful but struggles"" (Arifuta, Slime), next to the right of center would be ""My Attack didn't work I need to train more"" and this would include ""The struggle is real and adversity takes time to overcome"", not the greatest title I know, but anime in this category would be Shield Hero, Re-Zero, Devil is a part timer. And finally on the far right of my scale is Dark Isekai, this would include massive struggle,  major character deaths, etc. Anime I would place in this category are Grimgar Ash and Illusion, Now and Then, etc.     I can't help, but to believe the one ""acting behind the scenes"" to make everything smooth is the princess merchant of the land they just concurred.

(in bed)            the author's addiction to macheveli's the prince seems pretty obvious from the way souma is basically using that book as a means to govern as king, but that may tend to backfire in the worst way in the future!   also i wouldnt be surprised if he did indeed fake the death of carmine and his officers that wanted to die by suicide and basically created his own secret police. though i fear this may not end up well if he uses them like stalin to purge his political enemies!   and speaking of which, at least the author didn't gave souma's secret unit the same name as stalin's infamous secret unit which is what prince zorzal from G.A.T.E named his secret police when he became king!

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          159 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  8, 00:49 159 comments                 anime    After a delay, the second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero is here!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.

And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (159 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}
