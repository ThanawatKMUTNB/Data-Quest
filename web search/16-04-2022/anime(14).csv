Skeleton Knight in Another World is all about freeing elven and beast people/demi human slaves.   The Executioner and Her Way of Life  In your chat you talked about Menou, the Executioner, but failed to mention that she murders the innocent also.  Good or Evil doesn't matter, if you have the god tier skill, she will execute you.  While I like Menou and the series, Menou actions leave little to be desired.

Skeleton Knight in Another World is all about freeing elven and beast people/demi human slaves.   The Executioner and Her Way of Life  In your chat you talked about Menou, the Executioner, but failed to mention that she murders the innocent also.  Good or Evil doesn't matter, if you have the god tier skill, she will execute you.  While I like Menou and the series, Menou actions leave little to be desired.

Skeleton Knight in Another World is all about freeing elven and beast people/demi human slaves.   The Executioner and Her Way of Life  In your chat you talked about Menou, the Executioner, but failed to mention that she murders the innocent also.  Good or Evil doesn't matter, if you have the god tier skill, she will execute you.  While I like Menou and the series, Menou actions leave little to be desired.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 696       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

There's not really any wrong choice, the difference between character is insignificant and once you've recruited them they essentially stop existing for the most part.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.  Which seems like an oversight and an sign the release was a rushed product that didn't go through much testing.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

It is sad to hear about the censorship and performance issues in the remaster.  It seems to be a common trend with these things.  It's so sad companies with such iconic and legendary games give them such half-baked low-effort remasters.

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii.             That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 696       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

There's not really any wrong choice, the difference between character is insignificant and once you've recruited them they essentially stop existing for the most part.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.  Which seems like an oversight and an sign the release was a rushed product that didn't go through much testing.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

The Chrono Trigger bits do feel pretty forced and I feel the game overall would benefit more from it not trying to pretend it's a sequel to it.    It is sad to hear about the censorship and performance issues in the remaster.  It seems to be a common trend with these things.  It's so sad companies with such iconic and legendary games give them such half-baked low-effort remasters.

That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 696       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

There's not really any wrong choice, the difference between character is insignificant and once you've recruited them they essentially stop existing for the most part.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.  Which seems like an oversight and an sign the release was a rushed product that didn't go through much testing.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

It is sad to hear about the censorship and performance issues in the remaster.  It seems to be a common trend with these things.  It's so sad companies with such iconic and legendary games give them such half-baked low-effort remasters.

That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 696       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.           Thanks for the clarifying link! It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.  Which seems like an oversight and an sign the release was a rushed product that didn't go through much testing.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully. Some baffling uniform designs and perspective issues.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully. Some baffling uniform designs and perspective issues.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them.

Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it.

Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

Course, Spy x Family was basically a lock and Executioner and Birdie Wing seemed very likely, but I was unsure about Healer Girl and Demon Girl 2.

She was clearly very passionate about the source material (or is it source’s source material?), and that was always a treat to read.      I second this. It was an inevitable casualty, much like most of it's cast, but the weekly analysis/read-along companion will still be missed. I'm glad Precure survived, all things considered.   Also glad none of the reviewers got stuck with a hate-watch this season, and hopefully nothing that got picked will become one.

Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

Course, Spy x Family was basically a lock and Executioner and Birdie Wing seemed very likely, but I was unsure about Healer Girl and Demon Girl 2.

She was clearly very passionate about the source material (or is it source’s source material?), and that was always a treat to read.      I second this. It was an inevitable casualty, much like most of it's cast, but the weekly analysis/read-along companion will still be missed. I'm glad Precure survived, all things considered.   Also glad none of the reviewers got stuck with a hate-watch this season, and hopefully nothing that got picked will become one.

Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

She was clearly very passionate about the source material (or is it source’s source material?), and that was always a treat to read.      I second this. It was an inevitable casualty, much like most of it's cast, but the weekly analysis/read-along companion will still be missed. I'm glad Precure survived, all things considered.   Also glad none of the reviewers got stuck with a hate-watch this season, and hopefully nothing that got picked will become one.

I thought for sure that an amazing series that's ran for a decade would be covered.         Must not have gotten enough votes.            Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

She was clearly very passionate about the source material (or is it source’s source material?), and that was always a treat to read.      I second this. It was an inevitable casualty, much like most of it's cast, but the weekly analysis/read-along companion will still be missed. I'm glad Precure survived, all things considered.   Also glad none of the reviewers got stuck with a hate-watch this season, and hopefully nothing that got picked will become one.
