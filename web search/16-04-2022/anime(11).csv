Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?

Community score: 4.4            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.

Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.3                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Also, One Piece sure loves it's deadbeat dads, huh? I'm guessing Uta tries to stop Luffy becoming King of the Pirates or whatever her plot is because Shanks abandoned her.   Also Shanks is surprisingly cynical.

Also, One Piece sure loves it's deadbeat dads, huh? I'm guessing Uta tries to stop Luffy becoming King of the Pirates or whatever her plot is because Shanks abandoned her.   Also Shanks is surprisingly cynical.

Also, One Piece sure loves it's deadbeat dads, huh? I'm guessing Uta tries to stop Luffy becoming King of the Pirates or whatever her plot is because Shanks abandoned her.   Also Shanks is surprisingly cynical.

When I started this column I wondered to myself “I wonder when I'll order Naruto.” Well, it's been four years since then and here we are.

This time from Steins;Gate! And it has proper lab slippers! ―  Figma Rintarou Okabe Series: Steins;Gate Maker: GSC Price: ~$48 I've found that Steins;Gate is one of those “you haven't watched Steins;Gate?!” series, so I'm going to come out of the gate and say I haven't seen Steins;Gate.

News Early Manga Creator Tokuo Yokota Passes Away at 85   posted on 2022-04-13 22:56 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Death occurred 1 day after fellow Tokiwaso resident Fujiko Fujio A's passing    Early manga creator Tokuo Yokota passed away on April 8 due to senility. He was 85 years old. His funeral service is for close relatives.    Yokota was born in Fukushima in 1936. Inspired by creator Noboru Baba, Yokota aimed to become a manga artist.    Yokota debuted in 1955 with the manga Yamabiko Kenshi. He is known for Margaret-chan, which debuted in Shueisha's Weekly Margaret magazine in 1963, Anko-chan, which launched in Kodansha's Shōjo Club magazine in 1959, and Tamaoki-kun, which ran in Shonen Gatosha's Weekly Shonen King magazine. He specalized in gag manga.    He moved into the Tokiwaso apartment building, which also housed other early manga creators, in 1958. Yokota died one day after fellow Tokiwaso resident, manga creator, and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away.    The Tokiwaso is an apartment building in Toshima ward's South Nagasaki neighborhood.

He is known for Margaret-chan, which debuted in Shueisha's Weekly Margaret magazine in 1963, Anko-chan, which launched in Kodansha's Shōjo Club magazine in 1959, and Tamaoki-kun, which ran in Shonen Gatosha's Weekly Shonen King magazine. He specalized in gag manga.    He moved into the Tokiwaso apartment building, which also housed other early manga creators, in 1958. Yokota died one day after fellow Tokiwaso resident, manga creator, and Doraemon co-creator Fujiko Fujio A (real name Motoo Abiko) passed away.

It is famous for housing some of Japan's most renowned early manga artists, including Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy), Fujio Akatsuka (Tensai Bakabon), Fujiko Fujio (Doraemon), and Shotaro Ishinomori (Kamen Rider).

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again.

Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie.

It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain! I'm on my way!

16-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-14/.184603,Is Strong World Peak One Piece? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it.

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets.

Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.

Film's Teaser Announces July 15 Opening, Joint Screening With 10th Anniversary Film   posted on 2022-04-14 10:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         New Mirai e no Starway anniversary film reunites 1st series staff    The official website for BN Pictures' Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film debuted a teaser promotional video on Thursday. The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu! Planet seires premiered on January 10, 2021 and ended in June 2021.    The Aikatsu! franchise began with the original arcade card game in October 2012. The game inspired a television anime that ran from 2012 to 2016, and three anime films. The second entry in the franchise, Aikatsu Stars!, inspired a television anime that premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliates in April 2016. Aikatsu Stars! received an anime film in August 2016.    The third entry in the Aikatsu! franchise, Aikatsu Friends!, premiered in April 2018 along with the accompanying Aikatsu Friends! Data Carddass arcade game. A sequel television anime titled Aikatsu Friends! ~Kagayaki no Jewel~ (Shining Jewel) then  premiered in April 2018 with its own aracde game tie-in. The sequel is set two years after the story of Aikatsu Friends!, with the main character Aine Yūki now in high school.    The Aikatsu on Parade! television anime premiered on Saturday, October 5, 2019 with the new lead character Raki Kiseki and characters from the previous Aikatsu! anime series.    Sources: Aikatsu!

Film's Teaser Announces July 15 Opening, Joint Screening With 10th Anniversary Film   posted on 2022-04-14 10:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         New Mirai e no Starway anniversary film reunites 1st series staff    The official website for BN Pictures' Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film debuted a teaser promotional video on Thursday. The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu! Planet seires premiered on January 10, 2021 and ended in June 2021.    The Aikatsu! franchise began with the original arcade card game in October 2012. The game inspired a television anime that ran from 2012 to 2016, and three anime films. The second entry in the franchise, Aikatsu Stars!, inspired a television anime that premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliates in April 2016. Aikatsu Stars! received an anime film in August 2016.    The third entry in the Aikatsu! franchise, Aikatsu Friends!, premiered in April 2018 along with the accompanying Aikatsu Friends! Data Carddass arcade game. A sequel television anime titled Aikatsu Friends! ~Kagayaki no Jewel~ (Shining Jewel) then  premiered in April 2018 with its own aracde game tie-in. The sequel is set two years after the story of Aikatsu Friends!, with the main character Aine Yūki now in high school.    The Aikatsu on Parade! television anime premiered on Saturday, October 5, 2019 with the new lead character Raki Kiseki and characters from the previous Aikatsu! anime series.    Sources: Aikatsu!

Film's Teaser Announces July 15 Opening, Joint Screening With 10th Anniversary Film   posted on 2022-04-14 10:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         New Mirai e no Starway anniversary film reunites 1st series staff    The official website for BN Pictures' Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film debuted a teaser promotional video on Thursday. The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu! Planet seires premiered on January 10, 2021 and ended in June 2021.    The Aikatsu! franchise began with the original arcade card game in October 2012. The game inspired a television anime that ran from 2012 to 2016, and three anime films. The second entry in the franchise, Aikatsu Stars!, inspired a television anime that premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliates in April 2016. Aikatsu Stars! received an anime film in August 2016.    The third entry in the Aikatsu! franchise, Aikatsu Friends!, premiered in April 2018 along with the accompanying Aikatsu Friends! Data Carddass arcade game. A sequel television anime titled Aikatsu Friends! ~Kagayaki no Jewel~ (Shining Jewel) then  premiered in April 2018 with its own aracde game tie-in. The sequel is set two years after the story of Aikatsu Friends!, with the main character Aine Yūki now in high school.    The Aikatsu on Parade! television anime premiered on Saturday, October 5, 2019 with the new lead character Raki Kiseki and characters from the previous Aikatsu! anime series.    Sources: Aikatsu!

The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage.
