The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement.

The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion.

This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously.

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.

It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

But yeah, the crazy mix of music-oriented series with Eiko being cute as heck, and Kongming doing wacky stuff that just works are totally selling the series right now, no doubt. It's just too good combo.      Back to top                  meiam    Joined: 23 Jun 2013 		    Posts: 3215       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 6:42 pm            I've never really frequented club so maybe I'm missing something, but episode 2 big ""strategy"" seemed like an incredible stretch. It's a small room that people can get across in 5 second, could anyone really get lost in that? Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song. Anything better than sounding about as interesting as what you'd find on page 179 of youtube ""indie girl singing"" or something.

Maybe if everyone was really drunk (and possibly high) I could see it, but then I don't see anyone remembering Eiko afterwards.   I do wish the song were more interesting, there just... okay. I struggled to remember any of them even right after the show aired. That can work for the rival character, but its hard to root for a singer that has nothing interesting to offer. I understand its not easy to make good original song on demand, but they could have given her some interesting gimmick, maybe she could sing in some language/dialect that's not well known (Ainu or something, does Okinawan have their own language?) or she could have been part Chinese and sung with both Chinese and Japanese or be heavily influence by some form of Chinese song.

GN   Jan 26, 01:00 1 comment                 manga    The Girl I Want Is So Handsome! maintains a sense of light playfulness throughout, and it doesn't dip too hard into melodrama for most of the run. ― Like its title suggests, The Girl I Want is So Handsome! is a very basic and straightforward manga. When I was given a chance to review this series, all I wanted was a sweet, gay romance between a shy and bubbly high school student and her cool athletic ...                    review          9 comments       Vampire Dies in No Time 1-12 Streaming   Jan 25, 01:00 9 comments                 anime    The Vampire Dies in No Time is precisely what you'd expect from a series that ends with a dance-off. It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling. Sometimes, events may flow naturally from one chapter to the next. Other times, we get a chapter that is unrelated to any overarching narrative. And there are also one-shots...                    review          11 comments       Sing a Bit of Harmony   Jan 23, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Ahead of its opening in North American theaters, find out why Kim Morrissy calls the new film by Time of Eve director Yasuhiro Yoshiura a ""breezy family-friendly film that's easy to recommend to pretty much anyone."" ― In a year with both Mamoru Hosoda's BELLE and WIT Studio's Vivy -Fluorite Eye's Song-, a story about a singing AI robot doesn't seem like much of a novelty.

I was surprised at how much love, wholesomeness, and affection could be squeezed out from such a dreary and at times lewd premise. ― Despite the rather dark implications of the overall premise, I thought it was just another entry in the growing list of anime that are now making up this “teasing genre.” Than...                    review          2 comments       Came the Mirror & Other Tales GN   Jan 19, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work. ― Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    review          8 comments       Selection Project   Jan 17, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    When it's not bogging itself down with tonal filler, Selection Project is filling the central character conflict of its reality-show story with some of the wildest plot twists I've encountered in a series like this recently. ― A crowded field like idol anime means a series needs to have its own particular identity to stand out, and Selection Project's approach seems to be to pitch itself as at least ...                    review          3 comments       Shikizakura Episodes 1-12   Jan 16, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    As far as what it's playing with in terms of influence and genre stylings, Shikizakura is tokusatsu as all heck. ― Tokusatsu has enjoyed a run of increased availability and visibility among English-speaking audiences, particularly those adjacent to anime fan circles, for a good several years now.

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    review          5 comments       The Lines that Define Me GN 1   Feb 22, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    One young man's foray into classic Japanese art might just be his path to healing. ― Although The Lines that Define Me is about suiboku-ga, or traditional Japanese ink painting, that's really only the vehicle through which the characters express themselves. Aoyama, the protagonist, is clearly not doing well from the moment we meet him setting up for an art exhibit – he's worryingly lightheaded as he ...                    review          10 comments       The Two Lions GN   Feb 21, 01:00 10 comments                 manga    One of Furuya's strengths as a storyteller is the ability to carefully and quietly capture real emotions of the sort that we typically hide inside ourselves; the insecurities that grow unchecked and cause people to misunderstand us. ― The Two Lions is Nagisa Furuya's third English language release – Renta brought over S & N and Kodansha released My Summer of You – and if there's one thing all three t...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way.

It's a 'Man Versus Wild' situation if said Wild also had goblins in it. ― Alright, another new isekai, what's the deal with this one?

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

Successfully combining the two into a compelling narrative, therefore, isn't necessarily an easy feat. But if that's what ...                    review          5 comments       I Think Our Son Is Gay GN 2   Feb 13, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    The series could be read as a wish for all parents to be like Tomoko, who, while not without her flaws, is ultimately doing the best she can while being patient and respecting her son—and loving him no matter what. ― One of the strongest points in favor of Okura's I Think Our Son is Gay is how the focus isn't solely on Hiroki's potential sexuality.

There is political unrest, players have seemingly disappeared, and it's heavily implied that if you die in the game then you die in real life.

Written out, the story sounds like a cookie-cutter post-Free! sports anime, with a young man stumbling into a team of quirky but talented underdogs determined to finally make it to the Big Sports Competiti...                    review                Alice in Kyoto Forest GN 1   Feb  3, 01:00                 manga    We can tell very quickly that she's no longer in our world, not just because most of the people are gadding about in kimono and hand-drawn carts, but because the tails that some people have are clearly not a fashion accessory. ― If the name Mai Mochizuki sounds familiar, that's because this is her second English-language release: she's also the author of the Holmes of Kyoto light mysteries.

After a six-year hiatus, a split cour, and at least two weather-related delays, World Trigger has finally been able to conclude the Rank Wars arc. It feels like forever ago that Daisuke Ashihara took his sci-fi battle se...                    review          4 comments       Vampire Hunter D: Message from Mars GN   Feb  1, 01:00 4 comments                 manga    Currently up on KickStarter (and having far surpassed its goal with over US$170,000 pledged), check out the comic adaptation Rebecca Silverman calls a ""successful adaptation"" of Kikuchi's original work. ― You may have heard of this project.

The main one is that this is one of those yuri titles that goes in for some truly ridiculous breast physics and male gaze trappings – obviously not all lesbi...                    review          14 comments       Kiruru Kill Me GN 1   Jan 30, 01:00 14 comments                 manga    it was only a matter of time before some enterprising storyteller took the phrase ""God, I want her to kill me"" to its ultimately literal conclusion. ― It's the modern mantra elicited upon seeing a pretty lady: ""God, I want her to kill me.""

When I was given a chance to review this series, all I wanted was a sweet, gay romance between a shy and bubbly high school student and her cool athletic ...                    review          9 comments       Vampire Dies in No Time 1-12 Streaming   Jan 25, 01:00 9 comments                 anime    The Vampire Dies in No Time is precisely what you'd expect from a series that ends with a dance-off. It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling. Sometimes, events may flow naturally from one chapter to the next. Other times, we get a chapter that is unrelated to any overarching narrative.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.
