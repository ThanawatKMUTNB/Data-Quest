The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Nijigasaki High School is known for their diverse subjects and the freedom they give to students. Second-year student Yu Takasaki has been turned on to the charms of school idols, so she knocks on the door of the School Idol Club with her friend, Ayumu Uehara. Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Sometimes friends, sometimes rivals, the members of this club each contribute their own thoughts and motivations to the group.    Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is the latest entry in the Love Live! franchise and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I've gathered from fandom murmurings that, among the Love Live! canon, Nijigasaki is considered a bit of a black sheep. There are lots of reasons why: unlike the other three series in the franchise, it's a spinoff adapting the story of (one of) the mobile games rather than an original production. Instead of having a full-sized idol unit, the characters each perform solo, and the first season mostly consists of dedicated character episodes just to introduce us to this herd of school idols. It's also got a decidedly more laidback tone compared to the mainline shows, which can definitely be a bit of a disappointment if you're coming off the melodramatic highs of the original series or Sunshine. I get it. But at the same time Nijigasaki has charms of its own, and I was excited to get back to its particular brand of School Idolotry before Superstar comes back this summer.    And we're already off to a great start as this season premiere delivers something no other entry has given us so far: a full-on School Idol Rival. Yes, there was Arise and Saint Snow and Sunny Passion previously, but they were more like mentors than outright competitors – friendly new characters who could help our fledgling idols along the way and act as a benchmark for their future success. Not so for Lanzhu, who arrives fresh off a plane from Hong Kong to declare her bid for idol supremacy. She does so with unmatched style and confidence too, delivering one of Nijigasaki's iconic music video-style musical numbers with the flare of a true born mega star. She's essentially Nico Yazawa with the resources and power to back up her ambition, and that means a full song with lyrics like “The world revolves around me” and “That's how perfect I am, ah!” with the spectacle to back it up. A full blown School Idol Egomania has come to run wild over the Nijigasakids.    I gather that Lanzhu is a divisive character among fans of the mobile game, and she could very well turn irritating depending on how the show handles her, but as of right now I absolutely love this smug girl. She exudes the kind of energy you get from the best pro wrestling heels, and I think there's a lot of promise in having an actual antagonist for our crew of do-gooder school idols to go up against.    Outside of that introduction, this is otherwise business as usual for the Nijigasaki crew. Everyone's here to show off their defining gimmick once or twice, there's some shipteasing between various members, and we get some always-wonderful Kasumin faces to go along with it all. It's standard stuff meant to lead into Lazhu's introduction, and outside of the fanservice of putting the whole club in sharp-looking suits again, there's not much to it. These characters are all exactly who they were at the end of last season.    That's fine for now, but it's also something I hope this new season can address. We know all of these characters and their gimmicks pretty well – the whole first season was dedicated to that – but now we have a chance to see them develop and get fleshed out beyond that like previous Love Live! sequel seasons. If Lanzhu can help spur that, then she'll be a plenty worthy addition to the cast, and if she can't at least she'll look cool doing it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episodes 1-2  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5                  How would you rate episode 2 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.0          (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2 portion of the review is completely new.)  Episode 1:  Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists. Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.    Rating:                Episode 2:  After getting slightly derailed by last week's bandit attack, Arc is nonetheless determined to start out his new life right. And now that he has an adventurer's license, that can mean only one thing: embarking on the ultimate cliché newbie quest of picking herbs.    While it's somewhat played for comedy, we can once again see how committed Arc is to embrace this chance to live out his fantasy. Sure, he is well-qualified to do any number of more exciting quests, but since many classic RPGs start with a monotonous quest like this, he wants to make sure he gets every bit of the full experience.    Of course, that's not the only reason Arc chooses this quest. He is well aware that he is a stranger in a strange land. Standing out before he understands how the world works is dangerous. Even his armor—which he needs to hide his skeletal visage—brings unwanted attention. Not only is staying below the radar the safest option, but it is also the only way he can continue to have the freedom to do what he wants. Of course, with his ignorance of the relative strength between himself and his enemies, it seems like its only a matter of time until everyone knows his name.    Like with the first episode, this episode also makes it clear that, while Arc sees himself living a video game life, he doesn't see the people inhabiting the world as NPCs. He regards his young client as someone that is just as real is he is—and generally a better person than him. Likewise, this episode also reinforced that Arc is not arrogant. He treats every fight seriously—like his enemy is stronger than him even with all his gear and game knowledge.    Of course, we, the viewers, know that Arc is supremely overpowered but this episode does a good job at creating believable tension despite this. While Arc himself may not be in trouble at any point, the little girl accompanying him most certainly is. Poison breath, stone gaze, or even a simple attack from the monster would be enough to kill her. This serves to give Arc a handicap in the fight—forcing him to focus on dodging and defense rather than attacking. It's only when he knows for sure his sword will land that he finally strikes.    In the end, while it's not the most exciting episode, it continues to lay the groundwork for who Arc is as a person—how he views this new world and his place in it. Hopefully things will pick up a bit next week as we circle back to the elf he met back in the first episode.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   - It's a nice touch that the episode ends by giving us a metric to understand just how powerful Arc actually is. What he killed in one hit would normally take a couple of dozen trained soldiers to kill—and not without losses in the process.    - Ponta has a clear role in Arc's party: being cute. He does this very well.    - I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.    - That “Judgement” skill looked a lot like the Final Fantasy XIV paladin skill “Confiteor.” I wonder if the author plays the game too.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episodes 1-2  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5                  How would you rate episode 2 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.0          (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2 portion of the review is completely new.)  Episode 1:  Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists. Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.    Rating:                Episode 2:  After getting slightly derailed by last week's bandit attack, Arc is nonetheless determined to start out his new life right. And now that he has an adventurer's license, that can mean only one thing: embarking on the ultimate cliché newbie quest of picking herbs.    While it's somewhat played for comedy, we can once again see how committed Arc is to embrace this chance to live out his fantasy. Sure, he is well-qualified to do any number of more exciting quests, but since many classic RPGs start with a monotonous quest like this, he wants to make sure he gets every bit of the full experience.    Of course, that's not the only reason Arc chooses this quest. He is well aware that he is a stranger in a strange land. Standing out before he understands how the world works is dangerous. Even his armor—which he needs to hide his skeletal visage—brings unwanted attention. Not only is staying below the radar the safest option, but it is also the only way he can continue to have the freedom to do what he wants. Of course, with his ignorance of the relative strength between himself and his enemies, it seems like its only a matter of time until everyone knows his name.    Like with the first episode, this episode also makes it clear that, while Arc sees himself living a video game life, he doesn't see the people inhabiting the world as NPCs. He regards his young client as someone that is just as real is he is—and generally a better person than him. Likewise, this episode also reinforced that Arc is not arrogant. He treats every fight seriously—like his enemy is stronger than him even with all his gear and game knowledge.    Of course, we, the viewers, know that Arc is supremely overpowered but this episode does a good job at creating believable tension despite this. While Arc himself may not be in trouble at any point, the little girl accompanying him most certainly is. Poison breath, stone gaze, or even a simple attack from the monster would be enough to kill her. This serves to give Arc a handicap in the fight—forcing him to focus on dodging and defense rather than attacking. It's only when he knows for sure his sword will land that he finally strikes.    In the end, while it's not the most exciting episode, it continues to lay the groundwork for who Arc is as a person—how he views this new world and his place in it. Hopefully things will pick up a bit next week as we circle back to the elf he met back in the first episode.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   - It's a nice touch that the episode ends by giving us a metric to understand just how powerful Arc actually is. What he killed in one hit would normally take a couple of dozen trained soldiers to kill—and not without losses in the process.    - Ponta has a clear role in Arc's party: being cute. He does this very well.    - I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.    - That “Judgement” skill looked a lot like the Final Fantasy XIV paladin skill “Confiteor.” I wonder if the author plays the game too.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episodes 1-2  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5                  How would you rate episode 2 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.0          (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2 portion of the review is completely new.)  Episode 1:  Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists. Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.    Rating:                Episode 2:  After getting slightly derailed by last week's bandit attack, Arc is nonetheless determined to start out his new life right. And now that he has an adventurer's license, that can mean only one thing: embarking on the ultimate cliché newbie quest of picking herbs.    While it's somewhat played for comedy, we can once again see how committed Arc is to embrace this chance to live out his fantasy. Sure, he is well-qualified to do any number of more exciting quests, but since many classic RPGs start with a monotonous quest like this, he wants to make sure he gets every bit of the full experience.    Of course, that's not the only reason Arc chooses this quest. He is well aware that he is a stranger in a strange land. Standing out before he understands how the world works is dangerous. Even his armor—which he needs to hide his skeletal visage—brings unwanted attention. Not only is staying below the radar the safest option, but it is also the only way he can continue to have the freedom to do what he wants. Of course, with his ignorance of the relative strength between himself and his enemies, it seems like its only a matter of time until everyone knows his name.    Like with the first episode, this episode also makes it clear that, while Arc sees himself living a video game life, he doesn't see the people inhabiting the world as NPCs. He regards his young client as someone that is just as real is he is—and generally a better person than him. Likewise, this episode also reinforced that Arc is not arrogant. He treats every fight seriously—like his enemy is stronger than him even with all his gear and game knowledge.    Of course, we, the viewers, know that Arc is supremely overpowered but this episode does a good job at creating believable tension despite this. While Arc himself may not be in trouble at any point, the little girl accompanying him most certainly is. Poison breath, stone gaze, or even a simple attack from the monster would be enough to kill her. This serves to give Arc a handicap in the fight—forcing him to focus on dodging and defense rather than attacking. It's only when he knows for sure his sword will land that he finally strikes.    In the end, while it's not the most exciting episode, it continues to lay the groundwork for who Arc is as a person—how he views this new world and his place in it. Hopefully things will pick up a bit next week as we circle back to the elf he met back in the first episode.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   - It's a nice touch that the episode ends by giving us a metric to understand just how powerful Arc actually is. What he killed in one hit would normally take a couple of dozen trained soldiers to kill—and not without losses in the process.    - Ponta has a clear role in Arc's party: being cute. He does this very well.    - I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.    - That “Judgement” skill looked a lot like the Final Fantasy XIV paladin skill “Confiteor.” I wonder if the author plays the game too.

There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.    Rating:                Episode 2:  After getting slightly derailed by last week's bandit attack, Arc is nonetheless determined to start out his new life right. And now that he has an adventurer's license, that can mean only one thing: embarking on the ultimate cliché newbie quest of picking herbs.    While it's somewhat played for comedy, we can once again see how committed Arc is to embrace this chance to live out his fantasy. Sure, he is well-qualified to do any number of more exciting quests, but since many classic RPGs start with a monotonous quest like this, he wants to make sure he gets every bit of the full experience.    Of course, that's not the only reason Arc chooses this quest. He is well aware that he is a stranger in a strange land. Standing out before he understands how the world works is dangerous. Even his armor—which he needs to hide his skeletal visage—brings unwanted attention. Not only is staying below the radar the safest option, but it is also the only way he can continue to have the freedom to do what he wants. Of course, with his ignorance of the relative strength between himself and his enemies, it seems like its only a matter of time until everyone knows his name.    Like with the first episode, this episode also makes it clear that, while Arc sees himself living a video game life, he doesn't see the people inhabiting the world as NPCs. He regards his young client as someone that is just as real is he is—and generally a better person than him. Likewise, this episode also reinforced that Arc is not arrogant. He treats every fight seriously—like his enemy is stronger than him even with all his gear and game knowledge.    Of course, we, the viewers, know that Arc is supremely overpowered but this episode does a good job at creating believable tension despite this. While Arc himself may not be in trouble at any point, the little girl accompanying him most certainly is. Poison breath, stone gaze, or even a simple attack from the monster would be enough to kill her. This serves to give Arc a handicap in the fight—forcing him to focus on dodging and defense rather than attacking. It's only when he knows for sure his sword will land that he finally strikes.    In the end, while it's not the most exciting episode, it continues to lay the groundwork for who Arc is as a person—how he views this new world and his place in it. Hopefully things will pick up a bit next week as we circle back to the elf he met back in the first episode.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   - It's a nice touch that the episode ends by giving us a metric to understand just how powerful Arc actually is. What he killed in one hit would normally take a couple of dozen trained soldiers to kill—and not without losses in the process.    - Ponta has a clear role in Arc's party: being cute. He does this very well.    - I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.    - That “Judgement” skill looked a lot like the Final Fantasy XIV paladin skill “Confiteor.” I wonder if the author plays the game too.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episodes 1-2  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5                  How would you rate episode 2 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.0          (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2 portion of the review is completely new.)  Episode 1:  Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists. Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into?

Like with the first episode, this episode also makes it clear that, while Arc sees himself living a video game life, he doesn't see the people inhabiting the world as NPCs. He regards his young client as someone that is just as real is he is—and generally a better person than him. Likewise, this episode also reinforced that Arc is not arrogant. He treats every fight seriously—like his enemy is stronger than him even with all his gear and game knowledge.    Of course, we, the viewers, know that Arc is supremely overpowered but this episode does a good job at creating believable tension despite this. While Arc himself may not be in trouble at any point, the little girl accompanying him most certainly is. Poison breath, stone gaze, or even a simple attack from the monster would be enough to kill her. This serves to give Arc a handicap in the fight—forcing him to focus on dodging and defense rather than attacking. It's only when he knows for sure his sword will land that he finally strikes.    In the end, while it's not the most exciting episode, it continues to lay the groundwork for who Arc is as a person—how he views this new world and his place in it. Hopefully things will pick up a bit next week as we circle back to the elf he met back in the first episode.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   - It's a nice touch that the episode ends by giving us a metric to understand just how powerful Arc actually is. What he killed in one hit would normally take a couple of dozen trained soldiers to kill—and not without losses in the process.    - Ponta has a clear role in Arc's party: being cute. He does this very well.    - I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.    - That “Judgement” skill looked a lot like the Final Fantasy XIV paladin skill “Confiteor.” I wonder if the author plays the game too.

Community score: 3.5                  How would you rate episode 2 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.0          (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2 portion of the review is completely new.)  Episode 1:  Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists. Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.    Rating:                Episode 2:  After getting slightly derailed by last week's bandit attack, Arc is nonetheless determined to start out his new life right. And now that he has an adventurer's license, that can mean only one thing: embarking on the ultimate cliché newbie quest of picking herbs.    While it's somewhat played for comedy, we can once again see how committed Arc is to embrace this chance to live out his fantasy. Sure, he is well-qualified to do any number of more exciting quests, but since many classic RPGs start with a monotonous quest like this, he wants to make sure he gets every bit of the full experience.    Of course, that's not the only reason Arc chooses this quest. He is well aware that he is a stranger in a strange land. Standing out before he understands how the world works is dangerous. Even his armor—which he needs to hide his skeletal visage—brings unwanted attention. Not only is staying below the radar the safest option, but it is also the only way he can continue to have the freedom to do what he wants. Of course, with his ignorance of the relative strength between himself and his enemies, it seems like its only a matter of time until everyone knows his name.

Like with the first episode, this episode also makes it clear that, while Arc sees himself living a video game life, he doesn't see the people inhabiting the world as NPCs. He regards his young client as someone that is just as real is he is—and generally a better person than him. Likewise, this episode also reinforced that Arc is not arrogant. He treats every fight seriously—like his enemy is stronger than him even with all his gear and game knowledge.    Of course, we, the viewers, know that Arc is supremely overpowered but this episode does a good job at creating believable tension despite this. While Arc himself may not be in trouble at any point, the little girl accompanying him most certainly is. Poison breath, stone gaze, or even a simple attack from the monster would be enough to kill her. This serves to give Arc a handicap in the fight—forcing him to focus on dodging and defense rather than attacking. It's only when he knows for sure his sword will land that he finally strikes.    In the end, while it's not the most exciting episode, it continues to lay the groundwork for who Arc is as a person—how he views this new world and his place in it. Hopefully things will pick up a bit next week as we circle back to the elf he met back in the first episode.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   - It's a nice touch that the episode ends by giving us a metric to understand just how powerful Arc actually is. What he killed in one hit would normally take a couple of dozen trained soldiers to kill—and not without losses in the process.    - Ponta has a clear role in Arc's party: being cute. He does this very well.    - I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.    - That “Judgement” skill looked a lot like the Final Fantasy XIV paladin skill “Confiteor.” I wonder if the author plays the game too.

16-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/skeleton-knight-in-another-world/episodes-1-2/.184656,Episodes 1-2 - Skeleton Knight in Another World - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5                  How would you rate episode 2 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.0          (*Note: The review of the first episode is copy-pasted from when I reviewed it for The Spring 2022 Preview Guide—which also includes four additional reviews of this episode from other ANN reviewers. The episode 2 portion of the review is completely new.)  Episode 1:  Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists. Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.    Rating:                Episode 2:  After getting slightly derailed by last week's bandit attack, Arc is nonetheless determined to start out his new life right. And now that he has an adventurer's license, that can mean only one thing: embarking on the ultimate cliché newbie quest of picking herbs.    While it's somewhat played for comedy, we can once again see how committed Arc is to embrace this chance to live out his fantasy. Sure, he is well-qualified to do any number of more exciting quests, but since many classic RPGs start with a monotonous quest like this, he wants to make sure he gets every bit of the full experience.    Of course, that's not the only reason Arc chooses this quest. He is well aware that he is a stranger in a strange land. Standing out before he understands how the world works is dangerous. Even his armor—which he needs to hide his skeletal visage—brings unwanted attention. Not only is staying below the radar the safest option, but it is also the only way he can continue to have the freedom to do what he wants. Of course, with his ignorance of the relative strength between himself and his enemies, it seems like its only a matter of time until everyone knows his name.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

A new video shows how a Japanese artist transformed a Demon Slayer figure into a highly-detailed masterpiece that rivals even the most expensive scale statues.  The video comes from the YouTube channel Figure Brush Painting Channel [Maman] and documents how one talented artist was able to turn a comparatively simple Ichibankuji figure (a type of collectible statue frequently given out at Japanese stores and arcades as gifts or raffle prizes,) into an amazingly detailed showpiece that looks like it was pulled off of a manga page or animation cel. The Sound Hashira figure was given to the artist as a surprise at the beginning of the video. Using simple model paint applied by hand, the YouTuber explains how they upgrade the collectible, including how they add new details to the figure, such as the veins on Tengen Uzui's arms, and how they are able to recreate the anime series' shading and coloring style on a three-dimensional figure.  RELATED: Demon Slayer's Epic Anniversary Event Will be Livestreamed Worldwide    More of Maman's painting process videos and tutorials can be seen on their YouTube channel. In addition to their recreation of Demon Slayer's most flamboyant Hashira, the artist has also upgraded figures from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and has even dabbled into creating their own figures from scratch. The character of Tengen Uzui was first introduced in Demon Slayer's Hashira Meeting arc. Like many of the other Hashira, who are the highest ranked warriors within the Demon Slayer Corps, Uzui is initially hostile towards protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and his demonic sister Nezuko, but over the course of the series, a mutual respect develops between the self-proclaimed ""flamboyant"" ninja and the Kamado siblings. He plays a key role in the events of the Entertainment District arc, where the Hashira and his trio of wives partner with Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke and Nezuko to take down Upper Rank members of the Twelve Kizuki, Daki and Gyutaro. The arc is one of the most acclaimed parts of the original Demon Slayer manga, and was the basis for most of the anime series' second season, which was praised for studio Ufotable's feature-quality animation and action choreography.  RELATED: Demon Slayer: What Is Enmu’s Gender? Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba was created by Kotoharu Gotouge and first serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump in 2016. The complete manga series is now available in English from VIZ Media. The first two seasons of the anime are now available for streaming from Crunchyroll and Hulu. A third season, which will adapt the Swordsmith Village arc, has been confirmed to be in production but currently has no premiere date.

Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero revealed more details about one of its new villains, Dr. Hedo.  The new information comes from a special feature in the latest issue of Weekly Shonen Jump, which was scanned and shared online by Twitter user @DBSHype and translated by @DBSChronicles. While Dr. Hedo isn't the leader of the newly resurrected Red Ribbon Army, the magazine calls him the ""root of all evil in the new film."" Despite working with the bad guys, the scientist is apparently obsessed with superheroes, which is why he dresses in spandex and a cape and why he designed the movie's new androids, Gamma 1 and 2, to look the way they do. The page also highlights a mysterious machine in the center of Hedo's lab, which the magazine describes as being in an ""embryonic state."" Fans have theorized this machine contains Cell, a classic Dragon Ball Z villain who has been rumored to make an appearance in the new movie, though the film's producers have not mentioned anything officially about the character yet.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super Improved on Z's Biggest Problem - But Has It Done Enough?    Super Hero was recently given a new premiere date, June 11. The film was originally planned to release in Japan on April 22, but was indefinitely postponed on March 6 after Toei Animation, the studio that has produced Dragon Ball's anime adaptations since the 1980s, was hit with a targeted ransomware attack. The cyberattack delayed multiple projects within the studio, including production on the on-going One Piece and Digimon anime, which were forced to stop airing new episodes for about six weeks. Both shows have since resumed their broadcasts. Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero's North American release was originally planned to follow the Japanese premiere sometime this summer; the movie's producers have yet to announce if the movie will still be released internationally within the same premiere window, or if its release has been similarly pushed back.  The new movie features an original story set several years after the events of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film will focus on the relationship between Goku's son, Gohan, and his original martial arts master, Piccolo. The Namekian warrior will also receive a new transformation in the movie, whose name is tentatively being translated as the “Potential Unlocked” form, which gives Goku's former nemesis a new golden color scheme. The Dragon Ball Super manga is available in English from VIZ Media. All of the classic Dragon Ball TV anime series, including Dragon Ball Super, are now available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

Much of the beauty in Avatar: The Last Airbender came in the subtle details that proved nothing was too minor to merit expansion. While the overarching plot dealt with major problems involving the Hundred Year War, the realization of the Avatar in mastering the elements, and the growth and development of numerous beloved characters, one of the series' earliest minor plot points underwent a masterful arc of its own.  Katara's necklace could have been a throwaway detail in her character design that never saw any expansion. Instead, the creators of Avatar turned this into Season 1's subtlest and most effective plot point. RELATED: Avatar: Who Did Zuko End Up With?                Even as a subtle detail of her design, Katara's necklace was effective at showing her roots in the Southern Water Tribe that she carried with her throughout her adventures across the world. Over the course of the first season, the audience learned that it was also a token handed down to her from her mother, whose brutal slaying at the hands of the Fire Nation provided the backbone to Katara's own backstory. The necklace soon became symbolic of that relationship that shaped Katara's adventure, and the potency of the symbolism became all the greater as the necklace became a plot point unto itself.  As early as the sixth episode of the series, ""Imprisoned,"" the necklace tied into the overarching plot of the series when Katara lost it during a skirmish with the Fire Nation. Zuko's retrieval of the necklace not only provided the first season's main antagonist a way of tracking down Team Avatar -- a development not fully realized until nine episodes later -- but also established a personal rivalry between Katara and Zuko that would only grow all the greater throughout the series. Related: Avatar: The Last Airbender Boss Discusses the Show's Challenging Fight-Animation Style  The necklace did not become a convenient plot device that was only brought up when it advanced the story, either. Zuko teases Katara with the return of the necklace in ""The Waterbending Scroll,"" offering it in exchange for Katara turning over the Avatar. The offering stands out as the first time in the series that the two characters engaged directly with each other without anyone else interfering, setting up not only their sympathetic connection in the second season's finale but also Katara's antipathy toward Zuko, which lingered even after his heel-turn in the third season. In ""Bato and the Water Tribe,"" the necklace provided Katara's scent to aid Zuko in tracking down Team Avatar with the assistance of a bounty hunter. When Aang managed to retrieve it during his duel with Zuko, the episode ended with Aang returning the item to Katara as a consolation for her disconnection from her home, which was fleshed out during the course of the episode. It proved massively important across the nine episodes in which it was missing, and yet even still, the first season was not done integrating it into the plot.  RELATED: What Will Yangchen's Novel Reveal About The Avatar Before Her?             Master Pakku    ""The Waterbending Master,"" which immediately preceded the first season's two-part finale, centered the necklace as the keystone to its own plot. Within the episode, the waterbending master Pakku refused to tutor Katara due to the Northern Water Tribe's gender-restrictive traditions, but after Katara proved herself in a duel with Pakku, he recognized the item as a relic from his past. Revealed to be a betrothal necklace Pakku gave Katara's grandmother, it served as a reminder of how Pakku's strict traditionalism drove loved ones away in his life prior.  This realization caused Pakku to see the error of his ways and take Katara on as a student, setting her up for the mastery of waterbending that defined her as one of Avatar's strongest characters from there on out. Looking back over the series, it is remarkable how incredibly important such a small detail became -- and yet that has always been the magic of Avatar.

A new Shin Ultraman trailer released.  The latest preview for the new tokusatsu reboot primarily focuses on the human drama of the film, but also offers a few quick glimpses of the new kaiju (giant monsters) that the Giant of Light will have to do battle against. The trailer also features a look at Ultraman transforming and using his signature Ultra Beam attack. The clip also previews the new film's theme song, ""M87,"" which is performed by Japanese singer/songwriter Kenshi Yonezu. Shin Ultraman is scheduled to premiere in Japan on May 13. Details about the movie's international release have yet to be announced. RELATED: Ultraman, Van Helsing & Other Films & TV Shows to Watch on Netflix This Weekend    The new film is being directed by Shinji Higuchi, who previously co-directed 2017's Shin Godzilla and has worked in both the anime and tokusatsu industry for several decades. Higuchi previously worked on anime such as Wings of Honneamise, The End of Evangelion and Kill La Kill. The director is a frequent collaborator of Neon Genesis Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno, who wrote the script for the movie. Takumi Saitoh, who previously starred in the live-action Ace Attorney movie, stars in the movie as Shinji Kaminaga, the man who eventually becomes the human partner of the intergalactic hero known as Ultraman.  The movie will be the second entry in Higuchi and Anno's Shin series, which began with Shin Godzilla and will continue with 2023's Shin Kamen Rider. Shin Kamen Rider is being directed by Anno, and is a full reboot of Toei's long-running tokusatsu superhero show. Following the end of the Evangelion series with the release of the movie Evangelion 3.0 +1.01: Thrice Upon a Time in 2021, Anno stated his desire to move away from animation and work exclusively on live-action projects, such as Shin Ultraman and Shin Kamen Rider. The three Shin movies and Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion all make up the Shin Japan Heroes Universe, a cross-promotional campaign that will see characters from all four franchises coming together for unique merchandise and other events.  RELATED: Shin Ultraman Launches ThreeZero's New Line of Ultra-Detailed 6-Inch Figures In addition to returning to theaters, Ultraman's adventures on the small screen are also continuing with the recently released second season of the Ultraman anime, which was released exclusively on Netflix earlier this month. The CG-animated series serves as a direct sequel to the original 1966 live-action series and is set in a continuity that ignores the events of all of the other entries in the franchise. The anime is based on a 2011 manga written by Eiichi Shimizu and drawn by Tomohiro Shimoguchi, which is now available in English from VIZ Media.  ​​​​​​​ Source: YouTube                  Darth Vader's Perfect Match is Sabe, not Padme Amidala  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime ultraman     About The Author      Michael Lacerna                                     (1049 Articles Published)     Michael is one of CBR's Anime News Editors, a Link main in Smash Bros., and once tried to eat 100 tacos in one sitting (He tapped out after about thirty.)

Superman sports a striking white outfit in the upcoming DC Mech limited series, which also features the Man of Steel piloting a white mech suit.  The first issue of DC Mech, written by Kenny Porter and illustrated by Baldemar Rivas, features an adult Kal-El crashlanding on an Earth a far cry from its counterpart in the normal DC universe. On this Earth, Parademons from Apokolips ravaged the planet in the aftermath of World War II, and humanity was forced to adapt by designing massive robotic war suits. The robots are piloted by heroes like Batman and the Flash, who come to blows with the Man of Steel in DC Mech #1 before hashing out their differences to defeat Darkseid. RELATED: Death of the Justice League: Joshua Williamson Details How DC's Greatest Heroes Die                                Superman's sleek outfit is fully visible on Karl Kerschl's variant cover for Issue #1, showing the Man of Steel standing atop his white mech. Ricardo Lopez Ortiz's variant cover also shows the white-suited Superman facing off against Batman as their mechs duke it out in the background. The costume is vaguely reminiscent of red, blue and white containment suits that he wore in the '90s beginning with Superman #123 when his body began to radiate electrical energy, causing him to split into two separate beings. The costume also bears a resemblance to the all-white getup that he briefly donned in the finale of Blackest Night #8, released in 2010.  Along with Superman's outfit, all of the robot suits in the series were carefully designed by Rivas to reflect the personalities of the characters piloting them. ""I put a lot of research into the functionality of each unique mech, how they enhance their specific pilot's strengths and finding design elements that say something about each character as well,"" Rivas said when DC Mech was first announced. ""With the Batman mech, for example, I wanted to design a sleek and dark mech with stealth capabilities while still including a wide range of gadgets which relate to human Batman’s famous tools and fighting skills. I want these mechs to feel at home in the DC Universe and introduce something new and exciting, but familiar.""  RELATED: Naomi Proves Superman and Batman's Opposing Methods Are Essential to DC's Future Introducing a new but familiar take on DC's heroes is the point of DC Mech, Porter said, adding that the series is heavily influenced by his favorite childhood anime series like Mobile Suit Gundam. ""DC Mech is inspired by my deep love of the DC Universe and the mecha genre,"" Porter said. ""...I wanted to create a world with Baldemar that completely restructured the world around augmented pilots instead of superheroes."" DC Mech #1 comes from Porter and Rivas, with cover art by Rivas and variant cover art by Dan Mora, Ricardo López Ortiz and Karl Kerschl. goes on sale July 26 from DC.

The first issue of DC Mech, written by Kenny Porter and illustrated by Baldemar Rivas, features an adult Kal-El crashlanding on an Earth a far cry from its counterpart in the normal DC universe. On this Earth, Parademons from Apokolips ravaged the planet in the aftermath of World War II, and humanity was forced to adapt by designing massive robotic war suits. The robots are piloted by heroes like Batman and the Flash, who come to blows with the Man of Steel in DC Mech #1 before hashing out their differences to defeat Darkseid. RELATED: Death of the Justice League: Joshua Williamson Details How DC's Greatest Heroes Die                                Superman's sleek outfit is fully visible on Karl Kerschl's variant cover for Issue #1, showing the Man of Steel standing atop his white mech. Ricardo Lopez Ortiz's variant cover also shows the white-suited Superman facing off against Batman as their mechs duke it out in the background. The costume is vaguely reminiscent of red, blue and white containment suits that he wore in the '90s beginning with Superman #123 when his body began to radiate electrical energy, causing him to split into two separate beings. The costume also bears a resemblance to the all-white getup that he briefly donned in the finale of Blackest Night #8, released in 2010.  Along with Superman's outfit, all of the robot suits in the series were carefully designed by Rivas to reflect the personalities of the characters piloting them. ""I put a lot of research into the functionality of each unique mech, how they enhance their specific pilot's strengths and finding design elements that say something about each character as well,"" Rivas said when DC Mech was first announced. ""With the Batman mech, for example, I wanted to design a sleek and dark mech with stealth capabilities while still including a wide range of gadgets which relate to human Batman’s famous tools and fighting skills. I want these mechs to feel at home in the DC Universe and introduce something new and exciting, but familiar.""  RELATED: Naomi Proves Superman and Batman's Opposing Methods Are Essential to DC's Future Introducing a new but familiar take on DC's heroes is the point of DC Mech, Porter said, adding that the series is heavily influenced by his favorite childhood anime series like Mobile Suit Gundam. ""DC Mech is inspired by my deep love of the DC Universe and the mecha genre,"" Porter said. ""...I wanted to create a world with Baldemar that completely restructured the world around augmented pilots instead of superheroes."" DC Mech #1 comes from Porter and Rivas, with cover art by Rivas and variant cover art by Dan Mora, Ricardo López Ortiz and Karl Kerschl. goes on sale July 26 from DC.

How did each of these characters get their immortal bodies, and how do they function?                 Toward the end of the series, Sasuke revealed his plan to bare all of the world's hatred and establish lasting world peace. Naruto pointed out that even if he were to succeed today, Sasuke's plan isn't a permanent solution because he would eventually die. Sasuke countered by explaining that with the power he has, there are several ways for him to live forever. That statement wasn't wrong either. There are a surprising number of ways to achieve immortality in Naruto.  Numerous characters throughout the series have discovered some method of immortality. Some versions of immortality are more effective than others. Each version has its own pros and cons that come with it. Most of the individuals that achieved immortality belonged to the Akatsuki at one point or another. Let's discuss each immortal in Naruto and how their particular brand of immortality functions. RELATED: Naruto: Uchiha Sasuke's MBTI Personality Type & What it Says About Him          Orochimaru                Orochimaru's quest for immortality is probably the most well-known. As a young child, Orochimaru became obsessed with learning forbidden Jutsu. It eventually became his goal to learn every Jutsu in the world. But he soon realized that with his current body, that would be impossible. There wasn't enough time in a normal human lifespan, and there were particular techniques his body couldn't perform. To solve this problem, Orochimaru decided to become immortal.  Orochimaru actually developed two forms of immortality. The first method was his Immortality Jutsu. This technique allowed Orochimaru to transfer his soul into another body. Once the ritual was complete, Orochimaru would then have access to all the abilities of that body while still retaining all of his own knowledge and techniques. As long as Orochimaru could continue to take over new bodies, he would live forever. The downside to this Jutsu is that Orochimaru could only perform it once every three years. Also once those three years are up, his current body begins to rapidly decay, forcing him to find a new host.  The other method that Orochimaru developed was his Cursed Seal. Orochimaru placed a Cursed Seal on many of his subordinates. If they survived the application and learned to master it the Cursed Seal granted them a major power boost. Each Cursed Seal contained a piece of Orochimaru's chakra and soul inside of it. This allowed him allowed him to enact a limited amount of control over them. Because each seal contains a piece of Orochimaru's soul if he was killed he could be revived by releasing the seal and allowing his soul to inhabit a suitable body. Sasuke did this by using a piece of Kabuto's flesh, which contained Orochimaru's DNA and releasing Anko's Cursed Seal. The major con to this method of immorality is that it required other people to be willing to revive Orochimaru.  RELATED: Naruto: Why Does Kisame Hoshigaki Look Like a Shark?          Sasori                Sasori believed that the ultimate form of art was one that never changed or decayed. To better embody his ideal version of art, Sasori replaced his body with that of a puppet. As a puppet, Sasori no longer aged, grew tired, or required nutrition. He had turned himself into what he believed to be the perfect form of art while achieving immortality in the process. Although Sasori's puppet body would allow him to live forever, there were some severe downsides. Sasori's body cannot feel for instance. This can be beneficial at times since he can't feel pain, but that also means he can't experience any form of touch, including pleasure. Sasori's puppet body also still required chakra to function, which is why he had his living core of flesh implemented in the body. This core was also Sasori's most vulnerable spot and his greatest weakness.          Kakuzu                Kakuzu was one of the oldest living ninjas in the series. He was alive during the founding of the Hidden Leaf Village and had survived an assassination attempt against the First Hokage. Kakuzu was scorned by his village for failing his mission though. This disdain drove him to abandon the village but not before killing village elders and stealing their greatest, forbidden Jutsu. The Jutsu he stole was Earth Grudge Fear. This technique allowed Kakuzu to control black threads. These threads can reattach appendages almost instantly. The most important part of this ability is that Kakuza can use these threads to remove the beating hearts of his victims and add them to his own body. Doing this extends his life span, but if all the additional hearts are destroyed, Kakuzu dies as normal.  RELATED: How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment          Hidan                Kakuzu's partner in the Akatsuki also had a form of immortality. Hidan likely has the strongest version of immortality out of all those listed so far. Due to extensive experimentation and religious rituals, Hidan can survive almost any mortal wound. Not even decapitation can kill Hidan. This immortality also allows him to perform a Jutsu that reflects damage inflicted on himself onto his target. The only way that Hidan can naturally die is through malnutrition. The biggest downside to Hidan's immorality is that he can't instantly regenerate from wounds or lost limbs like Orochimaru. This means that Hidan can easily be incapacitated by removing his limbs. Shikamaru took advantage of this fact by blowing off Hidan's limbs and trapping him in a pit. Hidan was left to starve to death, which is a pretty gruesome way to go.          Impure World Reincarnation                During the Fourth Shinobi War, almost every deceased Akatsuki member was revived using Impure World Reincarnation and forced to fight in the war. These revived bodies also had a form of immorality. They could quickly regenerate from any damage they took and possessed infinite chakra. These revived shinobi were a massive advantage for the Akatsuki during the war. The revived shinobi were compelled to do the bidding of the person who resurrected them. When Kabuto used these ninjas in the war he often forced them to fight against their loved ones as a form of mental warfare. The only way to defeat these immortal ninjas was to seal their bodies or force the caster of the Jutsu to release them. Madara revealed that if the revived ninja knew the hand seals for the Jutsu they could break free of the caster's control and receive all of the benefits of the Jutsu without almost none of the setbacks.  RELATED: Naruto: How Sasori of the Akatsuki Became D&D's Nastiest Undead Villain          White Zetsu                The White Zetsu used by Madara and the Akatuski were created when Kaguya Ōtsutsuki tethered her subjects to the God Tree. Being connected to the God Tree for years turned these individuals into powerful soldiers loyal to Kaguya. She planned to use these White Zetsu to form an army to fight the rest of her clan, who were also immortal beings. The White Zetsu seemingly do not age. Even after hundreds of years since their creation, the White Zetsu army did not grow older or lose their strength. These soldiers also possessed incredible regenerative abilities. Their cells have been used to heal heavily injured bodies and grow new appendages. Those that have been turned into White Zetsu lose their original identity permanently. The White Zetsu appeared to lack a will of their own and follow the commands of those in charge without hesitation. Many characters in Naruto often fantasize about obtaining immortality, but more often than not, the negatives heavily out weight the positives.

Jujutsu Kaisen released new art to promote the shonen anime's new collaboration with Dolce & Gabbana.  As reported by Comic Natalie, the new illustration shows the series' main cast, including central hero Yuji Itadori and his sorcerer classmates Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki, decked out in some of the Italian luxury fashion brand's clothing. The character art was created by Sunghoo Park, the director of the first season of the Jujutsu Kaisen anime and the series' first movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen Play Debuts First Look at the Characters in Live-Action                The Italian company's exclusive Jujutsu Kaisen collection will launch at three pop-up stores in Japan on April 27. Two of the shops are are located in Tokyo's Shibuya and Shinjuku wards, while the third is in Osaka's Umeda district. The Shibuya store will feature a large display of Park's artwork and will only be accesible by customers who make a reservation beforehand. The collection will expand to Dolce & Gabbana's other locations throughout Japan on May 2. The clothing company has not announced plans to sell any goods from the collaboration outside of Japan.  Dolce & Gabbana is a high-end fashion company founded by Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana in 1985. The company's new anime team up will be released as part of the D & G brand, which is aimed at a younger audience than the fashion house's usual clientele. RELATED: How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche By most standards, D & G clothing isn't cheap, but the producers of Jujutsu Kaisen can certainly afford it, as the series has rapidly become one of Japan's biggest entertainment properites. The franchise debuted with a manga by writer and artist Gege Akutami in 2017 and is already one of the best-selling manga of all time, with over 65 million copies in circulation worldwide. Akutami's manga was also the best-selling series overall in Japan in 2021, narrowly edging out the reigning shonen champion, Koyoharu Gotouge's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, for the top spot with a whopping 30 million copies sold in that year alone. A well-received anime adaptation completed its first season in 2021 as well, and was followed up with the release of the franchise's first movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Released in Japan last Decemeber and internationally in March, the movie has already become one of the top ten highest-grossing anime films of all time. The anime's producers recently confirmed that the show will return for a second season, which will air sometime in 2023.  The first season of Jujustu Kaisen is available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Gege Akutami's manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Whether or not there is truth to this adage, Episode 2 of the latest high stakes game anime Tomodachi Game shows how difficult it can be to tell the difference between the two.  As Yuuichi and his closest friends continue to skirt around the limits of their goodwill, confidence is shaken and promises are broken. But all of this begs the question: is there really a traitor -- or is the game simply turning them against each other? RELATED: Why Summer Time Rendering Is the Mystery-Horror Anime to Watch This Spring                The episode picks up right where Episode 1 left off, with Yuuichi shaking up the rules of the Kokkuri game. Believing that one of the others was planning to unload the entirety of their debt on the meek Kokorogi, Yuuichi intentionally doubled his own debt for a chance to deliver an intimidating ultimatum to the hidden culprit in their midst. Ultimately, his gambit did not uncover the perpetrator's identity, but it did bring the game to a victorious conclusion, ensuring that everybody would move on to the next round without turning anybody into a scapegoat.  Before the second round of games began, Sawaragi approached Yuuichi, confiding that she had initially suspected him of being the one that stole the class funds to start the game. After Yuuichi admitted that he found Sawaragi most suspicious out of everybody, Sawaragi took the opportunity to confess her own romantic feelings for him. The two walked away with a resolve to make it through the game with everybody, but the conversation was overheard by a sullen Tenji, who seemed on edge as a result.                The group was then introduced to the next game by the newly rechristened Manabu-sensei. Set on a rooftop board game layout, the game required each player to secretly submit a note that may or may not have contained a piece of gossip, whether true or false, about one of their friends. The secrets were then ranked by their impact, with the subject of the juiciest burn being forced to move the most spaces toward the loser's circle.  RELATED: The Genius of Shigaraki Tomura, My Hero Academia's Symbol of Fear Although the five initially choose to leave all the ballots blank to prevent anyone from losing, Sawaragi was quickly singled out after two rounds of ties led to penalties for everybody. It is this first reveal that truly unpacks the sinister nature of the Tomodachi Game. The secret in question not only gives away the fact that Sawaragi has a crush on Yuuichi but also that she used to date Tenji, explaining his earlier demeanor.                This leads to a dispute between the boys of the group, as Shibe, who also has feelings for Sawaragi, is led to believe that the others have been mocking him all along. Meanwhile, Kokorogi, who clearly struggles with self-doubt, finds herself jealous of Sawaragi's popularity. The tension between them all only doubles when the next round alleges that Sawaragi has previously undergone plastic surgery.  RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen Play Debuts First Look at the Characters in Live-Action Many of the actions taken up to this point by the players could be seen as a means of manipulation. Sawaragi's declaration of affection for Yuuichi may have been genuine, but it could also be a ploy to get him on her side. Despite being the subject of the slander, she could be the one writing it as well to play the role of a victim. Likewise, Tenji's presence during their discussion and knowledge of her past set him up as one of the fishiest parties present. Even so, the most dangerous part of the Tomodachi Game is the way in which it keeps everybody's actions secret from each other.                 Regardless of any traitor among them, each game is set up to cast suspicion in all directions. The major overarching rule is that if any player shows their debt meter to another, that debt is doubled. This means that while someone can claim a certain effect on their debt from a game, there is no way to prove it. Similarly, the Kokkuri game gave each player a chance to give a yes-no question, but while all but the final round ended with a no, the impact of each round was obscured from everybody but the one reading the prompt. RELATED: Goodbye, Eri: Tatsuki Fujimoto's Cinematic One-Shot Blurs Reality and Fantasy  The ""bad-mouth"" board game is no different. Even if everybody present claims to leave a blank card, the presence of even one rumor casts suspicion on the whole team. Since they must submit their memo in a covert booth, there is no way to verify who wrote what. Additionally, as each round sows more dissent between the friends, there is more incentive to incriminate somebody else. In other words, rather than acting as the offender behind the game itself, the person writing ill about one of the others may simply be responding out of spite, which the game perpetuates.                Ultimately this is what makes the Tomodachi Game so devious. Even if there is a malefactor in their group, the gauntlet of activities creates an indiscriminate web of assumed duplicity, affecting each of the participants in turn. In such an atmosphere, the tiniest hint of disloyalty can breed full-on malice and hostility.  The closing shot of the episode, which shows Kokorogi breaking into a panic attack, certainly seems to imply that the situation will only escalate from here. Nevertheless, if they want to keep their friend from the literal rooftop edge awaiting at the end of the board, they must work together to finish the game as a single unit.

Home Anime Sasaki and Miyano Season 1's Biggest Unanswered Questions    Sasaki and Miyano Season 1's Biggest Unanswered Questions  By Nicky Rodriguez Published 15 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Here are some of the lingering questions fans might have following Sasaki and Miyano's delightful conclusion to its first season.                  The following contains spoilers for Season 1 of Sasaki and Miyano, now streaming on Funimation.   Sasaki and Miyano, the charmingly sweet BL anime that debuted in the winter 2022 anime lineup, just wrapped its first season last month. The final episode came with the promise of a new anime project, giving fans something to look forward to -- especially as the manga continues to be licensed in English. With all that anticipation for Season 2, there are probably some lingering questions fans are hoping the new season to address.  While Sasaki and Miyano may have finally confessed their feelings for each other and officially become a couple, their story isn't over. Here are a few details fans might be wondering about the co-protagonists and their crew -- and what that could mean for Season 2. RELATED: Sasaki and Miyano's Finale Delivers a Satisfying Romance - and Promises More          What Happens When Sasaki Graduates?                 It's come up numerous times that Sasaki will be graduating soon since he's one year older than Miyano. This fast-approaching milestone was something that weighed heavily on Miyano as he was working through his feelings for Sasaki in the wake of the latter's confession.  Sasaki and Miyano could easily take a more dramatic turn in how it chooses to address the possibility of the two considering a long-distance relationship -- or even a potential breakup. There's still plenty of comedic levity that can be injected though, depending on if Miyano were to have read a BL series with a similar trajectory of events and how that might paint the situation. With the anime's grounded, slice-of-life story, such an ordeal for the characters is within reason and could provide a source of tension for Season 2 given the series' relatively low stakes thus far. RELATED: Yashahime Season 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions          Will Sasaki and Miyano Meet Kuresawa's Girlfriend?                 Something else fans might be curious to see more of in Season 2 is Kuresawa and his relationship with his girlfriend, Fujimi. Kuresawa already mentioned that he wanted Sasaki to meet his girlfriend since the latter was the one who stepped in to help him during a fight -- which is, coincidentally, how Sasaki met Miyano. Fujimi is also a BL fan so, throughout the series, Kuresawa asks for recommendations and even shops with Miyano for manga to gift to her. Kuresawa, Sasaki and Miyano's friendships are interestingly intertwined -- having Fujimi interact with them all would not only flesh out her and Kuresawa's story, but would likely provide more touching moments centered around their friendship from varying perspectives.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling: The Biggest Plot Twists in Season 1          Will Kagiura Make an Appearance?                 It's inevitable that Sasaki and Miyano fans are hoping for Hirano to get more screentime to help tie into the Hirano and Kagiura spinoff novel and manga. As Miyano often likes to quip about the BL potential that comes with Hirano living in a boys' dorm, it's not impossible that Hirano's life outside of school couldn't slowly make its way into the series. Other characters like Hanzawa, Kuresawa, and even Ogasawara have gotten moments where fans saw more of their interpersonal engagements and struggles, so it makes sense that Hirano would be next, especially given the spinoff. Even if a new season isn't devoting a huge amount of time to introducing Kagiura and exploring his and Hirano's relationship, even a few moments would be guaranteed to be adorable -- and perhaps even comforting for Sasaki and Miyano as they begin their relationship together.  There's still little known about what the second season of Sasaki and Miyano will cover and how long it'll be, but there's certainly plenty of material left in the ongoing manga that can be incorporated. Whatever it may be, fans can likely expect more wholesome bits of love and friendship between Sasaki, Miyano and their colorful group of friends.

It's been four years since Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga made its debut in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump, and the magazine is celebrating the milestone with some epic new artwork.  According to the Manga Morgura RE Twitter, Jujutsu Kaisen will be featured on the cover of ""the upcoming Weekly Shounen Jump issue 20/2022 to celebrate its 4th anniversary."" In the accompanying image, protagonist Yuji Itadori, his classmate Megumi Fushiguro and upperclassmen Yuta Okkotsu appear ready to throw down. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Teams Up With Uniqlo for New Graphic Tee Collection      Akutami's story follows Yuji, a high school student, who joins a secret organization to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer after he unwittingly becomes the host to Ryomen Sukuna, the undisputed King of Curses. Upon the manga's release in March 2018, Jujutsu Kaisen quickly gained a passionate fan following; as of April 2022, the series has sold over 65 million copies. The manga has also performed exceedingly well with critics and industry professionals, having been nominated for the 65th Shogakukan Manga Award in 2019 and winning the Mandō Kobayashi Manga Grand Prix in 2020.  The Jujutsu Kaisen manga series has been adapted into an anime by MAPPA (Attack on Titan: The Final Season) with the first season airing in 2020 and a second season scheduled to premiere in 2023. Like the manga, the show has been a financial and critical success. At the fifth annual Crunchyroll Anime Awards, Jujutsu Kaisen won Anime of Year, Best Antagonist and Best Ending Sequence. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Just Hinted at an Intriguing Third Sorcery School Other recent developments for the Jujutsu Kaisen franchise include a live-action stage play adaption of the story, which will premiere in Tokyo this summer. Images of the cast in their manga-accurate costumes were released online to promote the upcoming performances.  Moreover, the anime's tie-in prequel movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0, recently broke $30 million dollars at the US box office. As previously reported, the film was the highest-grossing movie in Japan in 2021 and is one of the highest-grossing anime films ever, alongside classics like Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away. The financial success of Jujutsu Kaisen 0 has galvanized many cast members to speak out about unfair pay rates for voice actors. Tara Jayne Sands, who plays Momo Nishimiya and Utahime Iori in the English dub, revealed she was only paid $150 for her role in the film. Kaiji Tang, who stars as fan-favorite Satoru Gojo, made similar criticisms of the anime dubbing industry.  The Jujutsu Kaisen manga is distributed in English by VIZ Media and the anime is available on Crunchryroll.

The following contains spoilers for Deaimon Episode 2, “Echoing Through the Hydrangea,” now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Deaimon continues this week in its campaign of soft, heartfelt stories, but while viewers might have expected the show to continue along the path of developing the father/daughter relationship between Irino Nagomu and Yukihira Itsuka, it instead takes a sharp turn, focusing on an entirely different character and leaving the show feeling a little directionless.  Horikawa Mitsuru is a high school employee at the sweet shop, and it is her desire to pursue music as a career that takes complete center stage. While fleshing out side characters is certainly the sign of a quality anime, to switch focus by Episode 2 might signify that Nagomu and Itsuka don't have much of a story to tell, and this is a bad omen for the future of Deaimon as a whole. Related: Kaguya-sama: Who Is the Legendary Princess That Inspired Kaguya's Name?                 Contained within the individual episode, Deaimon continues to know how to hit those sweet notes. Mitsuru's dilemma comes from being the eldest, responsible child in her family with a certainty that pursuing music would disappoint her parents. This leads to her donning a mask when she records herself playing original songs and then soaking up the praise from the internet while knowing it won't last. However, when a slight mishap threatens to expose her identity, Nagomu urges her to tell her parents to see what their reaction is, instead of just assuming they will be disappointed. As a failed musician himself, Nagomu feels he has some experience to speak from, but Mitsuru shocks him by saying that she was a fan of his music, meaning it wasn't all for nothing.  Hopefully, this topic gets covered more thoroughly in the future because Nagomu cannot be expected to be the pillar of support for too many characters without having his own psyche subject to evaluation. His happy-go-lucky attitude is a positive trait, but so far, he has not been explored in any sort of depth, leaving the question as to how the death of a favorite grandparent, being passed over for successor at the family business and ten years of musical failure could possibly spit out someone whose biggest daily worries are that the sweets are too cute to be eaten. If Nagomu fails to be given any sort of depth here, he cannot possibly develop the cathartic relationship with Itsuka that Episode 1 seemed to promise. However, he serves his purpose in urging Mitsuru on in pursuit of her dreams, and it's wonderful to see what happens when an anime sees no purpose in adding melodrama or pointless misunderstandings, although the lack of true conflict did leave Episode 2 feeling a little slow.  Related: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Echoes 2020's Most Wholesome Rom-Com                 Once again, comparing Deaimon to similar slice-of-life anime demonstrates how it might be floundering. Sweetness and Lightning made it clear right away that the father saw cooking as a way to hold his family together, even after his wife passed away. The anime actually showed the characters making recipes and continued to focus on the cooking aspect even as more emotional elements were added, and the audience came to understand just how important this was to him. Barakamon didn't include cooking but did feature a protagonist who was as responsible for his own life as Nagomu, but while he suffered for that part of his personality, Nagomu is perfectly happy to be back home and even happy to be given the task of taking Itsuka under his wing, while Handa Sei in Barakamon was dead-set against the idea of even interacting with children when the story began. Since Itsuka hasn't bonded with Nagomu, losing him now would mean nothing, meaning that the only true conflict in the entire show is Itsuka's feeling of abandonment -- which, as of Episode 2, has received less than a minute of screen time.  Timing is going to be more important than ever in getting the show back on track. The emotional beats have to be precise in order for there to be the catharsis the show is surely aiming for, yet the anime is stumbling already. While side characters like Mitsuru are important, Episode 3 can hopefully pace itself to focus on the two that matter most and then work to give Nagomu and Itsuka the slow, careful build-up they require for their father/daughter relationship to truly resonate.

Home Anime Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels    Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels  By Timothy Donohoo Published 16 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Featuring a race to find a mushroom to cure a rust plague, Rust-Eater Bisco is a post-apocalyptic adventure.                 There are many post-apocalyptic anime out there, although none of them are known for featuring toxic dust. That's where Sabikui Bisco, or Rust-Eater Bisco, comes in. Mushrooming from light novel series to manga to anime, Bisco has been a success in many forms for over four years now. Of course, the interesting name and the presence of giant crabs in the story probably help.  The anime for the series began this year, just as the original light novels began their localization in the West. Thus, now is the best time to get into the franchise before it grows to a daunting size. Before the mushroom-based rust infects us all, here's a rundown of what Rust-Eater Bisco is about and where to enjoy it in different mediums. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga           The Plot of Rust-Eater Bisco                 Rust-Eater Bisco is set in a dystopian Japan where society has been besieged by a mysterious substance known as rust. This pandemic of the wind affects everything that it touches, and humans are not immune to it. The main character is the eponymous Bisco, an archer who can shoot arrows that instantly sprout mushrooms. Given that mushrooms are believed to be the source of rust, Bisco is despised by society and seen as a criminal.  Bisco teams up with a doctor named Milo, and they, along with Bisco's gigantic crab, venture off to find a mythical type of mushroom called sabikui that can devour rust once and for all. Both of these men have loved ones who are affected in some way by the plague, making their journey that much more personal. The premise also feels somewhat like a reversal of the hit series Dr. Stone. RELATED: DanMachi: How to Get Started With the Anime, Manga & Light Novels           Where to Read the Rust-Eater Bisco Light Novels and Manga                 Rust-Eater Bisco was created by Shinji Cobkubo and K Akagashi, beginning as a light novel series in early 2018. So far amassing eight volumes, the series has been ongoing ever since. Yen Press began localizing the light novels this year, although only the first has made it over so far, with two more scheduled for May and August releases respectively. There's also a manga adaptation of the light novels, with the first part being made up of four volumes and the second beginning earlier this year.  The single Rust-Eater Bisco light novel volume released so far can be bought from Amazon, Walmart, Books-A-Million and Barnes & Noble. It's also available digitally to read on Kindle, although it's surprisingly not on the new version of Comixology yet. RELATED: Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Where to Watch the Rust-Eater Bisco Anime                 The Rust-Eater Bisco anime is handled by the studio OZ, with Atsushi Itagaki and Sadayuki Murai directing and writing the series respectively. Announced in March 2021, three years after the light novel series debuted, it ran for 12 episodes from January to March 2022. A second season isn't impossible, but it will likely have to wait until there's more material to adapt.  Currently, Rust-Eater Bisco is available to stream on both Funimation and Crunchyroll. Given that it just ended its run on Japanese television, it will likely be a while before there's a physical release, let alone one in the West. Thus, streaming the show now is the best and fastest way to enjoy the story so far.

16-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.cbr.com/rust-eater-bisco-where-watch-anime-read-novels/,Where to Watch & Read Rust-Eater Bisco,"      Home Anime Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels    Rust-Eater Bisco: How to Get Started With the Anime & Light Novels  By Timothy Donohoo Published 16 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Featuring a race to find a mushroom to cure a rust plague, Rust-Eater Bisco is a post-apocalyptic adventure.                 There are many post-apocalyptic anime out there, although none of them are known for featuring toxic dust. That's where Sabikui Bisco, or Rust-Eater Bisco, comes in. Mushrooming from light novel series to manga to anime, Bisco has been a success in many forms for over four years now. Of course, the interesting name and the presence of giant crabs in the story probably help.  The anime for the series began this year, just as the original light novels began their localization in the West. Thus, now is the best time to get into the franchise before it grows to a daunting size. Before the mushroom-based rust infects us all, here's a rundown of what Rust-Eater Bisco is about and where to enjoy it in different mediums. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga           The Plot of Rust-Eater Bisco                 Rust-Eater Bisco is set in a dystopian Japan where society has been besieged by a mysterious substance known as rust. This pandemic of the wind affects everything that it touches, and humans are not immune to it. The main character is the eponymous Bisco, an archer who can shoot arrows that instantly sprout mushrooms. Given that mushrooms are believed to be the source of rust, Bisco is despised by society and seen as a criminal.  Bisco teams up with a doctor named Milo, and they, along with Bisco's gigantic crab, venture off to find a mythical type of mushroom called sabikui that can devour rust once and for all. Both of these men have loved ones who are affected in some way by the plague, making their journey that much more personal. The premise also feels somewhat like a reversal of the hit series Dr. Stone. RELATED: DanMachi: How to Get Started With the Anime, Manga & Light Novels           Where to Read the Rust-Eater Bisco Light Novels and Manga                 Rust-Eater Bisco was created by Shinji Cobkubo and K Akagashi, beginning as a light novel series in early 2018. So far amassing eight volumes, the series has been ongoing ever since. Yen Press began localizing the light novels this year, although only the first has made it over so far, with two more scheduled for May and August releases respectively. There's also a manga adaptation of the light novels, with the first part being made up of four volumes and the second beginning earlier this year.  The single Rust-Eater Bisco light novel volume released so far can be bought from Amazon, Walmart, Books-A-Million and Barnes & Noble. It's also available digitally to read on Kindle, although it's surprisingly not on the new version of Comixology yet. RELATED: Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Where to Watch the Rust-Eater Bisco Anime                 The Rust-Eater Bisco anime is handled by the studio OZ, with Atsushi Itagaki and Sadayuki Murai directing and writing the series respectively. Announced in March 2021, three years after the light novel series debuted, it ran for 12 episodes from January to March 2022. A second season isn't impossible, but it will likely have to wait until there's more material to adapt.  Currently, Rust-Eater Bisco is available to stream on both Funimation and Crunchyroll. Given that it just ended its run on Japanese television, it will likely be a while before there's a physical release, let alone one in the West. Thus, streaming the show now is the best and fastest way to enjoy the story so far.

By now there's a lot for fans to keep track of, including who the heroes and villains are. The cast of characters is bigger than ever.  Protagonist Naofumi Iwatani has more than nameless skeleton warriors and slime critters to fight in this isekai adventure. He must also face off against rival Heroes who are fighting for the sake of their own worlds -- including the scythe-wielding villain L'Arc Berg, who has already crossed blades with Naofumi's party once. Who is L'arc exactly, and what can he do? Here's the full scoop. RELATED: Shield Hero: Who is the True Ruler of Melromarc?          The Origins, Mission & Abilities Of L'Arc Berg                L'Arc Berg is not from the kingdom of Melromarc, the neighboring nation of Siltvelt or anywhere else on the world map that the unfortunate hero Naofumi has yet seen. Rather, L'Arc and his trusted companion Theresia Alexanderite are actually from a world beyond the interdimensional Waves, a mysterious homeland that future seasons of Shield Hero may explore in greater detail.  Incidentally, this is the same world from which the fan-slinging, kimono-wearing villain Glass originates, though these two characters have very different styles of dress. This suggests that L'Arc's homeworld has more than one nation and culture and is far from homogeneous. If so, that makes it similar to the world in which Melromarc is found, which also has rich diversity. RELATED: Shield Hero: What You Should Know About the Filolial Race L'Arc is more than a cannon fodder soldier or archer in Shield Hero. He is a proper Vassal Hero who wields a fancy scythe, which makes him similar to the four Cardinal Heroes. Unlike them, however, L'Arc seemingly was not summoned from Earth as an isekai adventurer but is fully native to the world from which the Waves originate, making him more similar to Raphtalia or Filo in that regard. Unlike the Cardinal Heroes, who had to hurry and train with their weapons upon arriving in Melromarc, it's likely that L'Arc has been training as the scythe Hero of his homeworld for many years, which should give him an edge.  Highly effective with his expert speed, strength, technique and intuition, L'arc is able to take on Naofimi's entire adventurer party and the Cardinal Heroes in battle with only a single companion of his own, Theresia, to back him up. Individually, L'Arc almost definitely outclasses the Cardinal Heroes, and is even more effective when he uses wind-based scythe moves -- similar to what Filo can do with her wings. Then, when Theresia backs him up with her elemental magic via her jewel, L'Arc becomes nigh-unstoppable in battle. RELATED: Shield Hero: The Berserk-Style Power of Naofumi's Rage Shield          L'Arc Berg's Role In Shield Hero So Far                L'Arc Berg has made only a token appearance so far in Rising of the Shield Hero, but that was enough to make a strong impression and establish most of the basic details of his role in the story. He and Theresia were introduced together as the brief ""Cal Mira"" story arc began, with L'Arc introducing them to Naofumi aboard the ship headed to Cal Mira archipelago. L'Arc was soon established as a generous and proactive fellow who thought highly of Naofumi, to the point he didn't believe Naofumi was the Shield Hero due to the dark ""devil of the Shield"" rumors going around.  L'Arc and Theresia fought alongside Naofumi's party to grind XP and level up during the Cal Mira beach event, but when the Wave arrived, he and Naofumi soon found themselves on opposite sides. L'Arc fought alongside Glass and Theresia against the Cardinal Heroes, deeming all of them except Naofumi to be weak and foolish -- which the Cardinal Heroes took offense to. He also explained how he's bound by duty to slay the four Cardinal Heroes to save his own world. Naofumi won't just surrender and die to him, but surely a part of him understands L'Arc's position, which might pave the way to a cease-fire or reconciliation in future episodes. The two have gone their separate ways for now, but when they next cross paths in Shield Hero, things might be different. Naofumi could sure use a break, at least.  The Rising of the Shield Hero is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Hulu.

Could this season change that for the genre?                 Like most other media, anime genres experience highs and lows in popularity. For the past decade or so, isekai shows have dominated the medium, and there are no signs of it slowing down. In contrast, sports anime has hit something of a slump -- these shows simply haven't made the same kind of impact on the fan base as they did even five years ago. Most of the popular shows from that time have either been completed or have no sign of another season coming soon. Meanwhile, new sports series have often failed to meet expectations.  However, the Spring 2022 season just may change this trend. This season has an unprecedented five sports titles, none of which cover the same activity. From soccer to horse racing, they each have their own qualities to offer viewers. Of these, the three highest-ranking on MyAnimeList all have plenty of potential. Whether it's for the animation studio or the story they plan to tell, these anime just might take the genre out of its rut. RELATED: Haikyuu!!'s Uplifting Ending, Explained          Aoashi This series is backed by anime fans who pay attention to the studios that handle the animation. Produced by Production I.G, known for its impressive work on widely acclaimed shows such as Vinland Saga and the early seasons of both Attack on Titan and Haikyuu!!, Aoashi already has a pedigree. On top of this, it creates an excellent setup for a sports series in its first episode with an obviously flawed protagonist.  Ashito Aoi establishes himself right away as a competent soccer player. Whenever he has the ball, he can score a goal. However, this is also a problem for other players on the field. Ashito's team's main strategy is to pass him the ball and let him score, which makes him come across as self-centered to his opponents. Their assumptions aren't wrong -- Ashito admits that he's selfish, but his team accepts that. This attitude may have worked for him so far, but it's also had its consequences: due to his reputation and immaturity, he loses an opportunity to be scouted for a well-known high school team.  By the end of Episode 1, he is given a chance to go to Tokyo and join a team, but only after proving his dedication to improving in the sport. Ashito sees the task his new coach has given him as a challenge, and as a result, works himself to the bone to get it right. In a single episode, Aoashi establishes the main character's strengths and weaknesses in a balanced manner. He isn't a prodigy or someone who can do one thing really well -- he's a kid with a passion and plenty of room to grow. RELATED: Why Fans of Haikyuu Will Love Aoashi          Dance Dance Danseur                 Dance Dance Danseur similarly has a famous animation studio backing it. MAPPA, known for working on Jujutsu Kaisen, the later seasons of Attack on Titan and the upcoming Chainsaw Man adaptation, is responsible for bringing this anime to life. Episode 1 shows the studio's legendary resume in minutes with its first showcase of ballet, in a stunning performance that doesn't utilize polarizing CG animation.  However, the bigger draw for many fans is the message that it's setting up to tell. The main character, Junpei, fell in love with ballet as a child and pushed himself to get involved despite his father's brief opposition. Then tragedy struck and, suddenly, Junpei felt that he needed to throw away his ""feminine"" interest. Whether intentional or not, expectations and comments from those around him pushed him to follow in his father's footsteps, so he gave up ballet for martial arts. Despite his insistence that he's over dancing, it's clear to the audience that he isn't. He still longs for it but stops himself most of the time. This is why, while his reason for picking it back up is a girl he likes, Junpei returning to ballet feels genuine. Even in doing things that are supposed to make him a man, Junpei is led back to the studio every day. While dancing, he feels sensations that he never gets from martial arts. How he deals with rediscovering his love and letting other people know about it will be the main driver of this series.  RELATED: Dance Dance Danseur is a Formulaic But Still Important Takedown of Toxic Masculinity           Love All Play                 Love All Play is more of a wildcard, but what it has can lead to something great. In recent years, multiple anime have been made about badminton, but none of them have become more than a passing interest in the community at large. Hanebado took itself too seriously for many viewers, while Salaryman's Club fumbled on aspects as simple as its basic premise. With two episodes currently available, Love All Play is striking a good balance between slice of life and sports. Mizushima Ryo and his friends stumbled into the badminton club by accident one day and never left. Now that they're reaching the end of middle school, they have to decide which high schools to attend. Ryo is offered a sports scholarship to a prominent high school, but this perfect chance doesn't go the way it's expected to. His family disapproves of the idea; they don't want him to depend on physical ability, so he decides to get into the school by way of his grades.  With a first episode focusing on school life, Episode 2 switches to badminton. In a practice meant to test the abilities of Ryo and other team hopefuls, the audience gets a glimpse of each character's skill level and personality. While Love All Play doesn't immediately seem like anything special, it has the potential to be a solid sports anime.

In contrast, sports anime has hit something of a slump -- these shows simply haven't made the same kind of impact on the fan base as they did even five years ago. Most of the popular shows from that time have either been completed or have no sign of another season coming soon. Meanwhile, new sports series have often failed to meet expectations.  However, the Spring 2022 season just may change this trend. This season has an unprecedented five sports titles, none of which cover the same activity. From soccer to horse racing, they each have their own qualities to offer viewers. Of these, the three highest-ranking on MyAnimeList all have plenty of potential. Whether it's for the animation studio or the story they plan to tell, these anime just might take the genre out of its rut. RELATED: Haikyuu!!'s Uplifting Ending, Explained          Aoashi This series is backed by anime fans who pay attention to the studios that handle the animation. Produced by Production I.G, known for its impressive work on widely acclaimed shows such as Vinland Saga and the early seasons of both Attack on Titan and Haikyuu!!, Aoashi already has a pedigree. On top of this, it creates an excellent setup for a sports series in its first episode with an obviously flawed protagonist.  Ashito Aoi establishes himself right away as a competent soccer player. Whenever he has the ball, he can score a goal. However, this is also a problem for other players on the field. Ashito's team's main strategy is to pass him the ball and let him score, which makes him come across as self-centered to his opponents. Their assumptions aren't wrong -- Ashito admits that he's selfish, but his team accepts that. This attitude may have worked for him so far, but it's also had its consequences: due to his reputation and immaturity, he loses an opportunity to be scouted for a well-known high school team.  By the end of Episode 1, he is given a chance to go to Tokyo and join a team, but only after proving his dedication to improving in the sport. Ashito sees the task his new coach has given him as a challenge, and as a result, works himself to the bone to get it right. In a single episode, Aoashi establishes the main character's strengths and weaknesses in a balanced manner. He isn't a prodigy or someone who can do one thing really well -- he's a kid with a passion and plenty of room to grow. RELATED: Why Fans of Haikyuu Will Love Aoashi          Dance Dance Danseur                 Dance Dance Danseur similarly has a famous animation studio backing it. MAPPA, known for working on Jujutsu Kaisen, the later seasons of Attack on Titan and the upcoming Chainsaw Man adaptation, is responsible for bringing this anime to life. Episode 1 shows the studio's legendary resume in minutes with its first showcase of ballet, in a stunning performance that doesn't utilize polarizing CG animation.  However, the bigger draw for many fans is the message that it's setting up to tell. The main character, Junpei, fell in love with ballet as a child and pushed himself to get involved despite his father's brief opposition. Then tragedy struck and, suddenly, Junpei felt that he needed to throw away his ""feminine"" interest. Whether intentional or not, expectations and comments from those around him pushed him to follow in his father's footsteps, so he gave up ballet for martial arts. Despite his insistence that he's over dancing, it's clear to the audience that he isn't. He still longs for it but stops himself most of the time. This is why, while his reason for picking it back up is a girl he likes, Junpei returning to ballet feels genuine. Even in doing things that are supposed to make him a man, Junpei is led back to the studio every day. While dancing, he feels sensations that he never gets from martial arts. How he deals with rediscovering his love and letting other people know about it will be the main driver of this series.  RELATED: Dance Dance Danseur is a Formulaic But Still Important Takedown of Toxic Masculinity           Love All Play                 Love All Play is more of a wildcard, but what it has can lead to something great. In recent years, multiple anime have been made about badminton, but none of them have become more than a passing interest in the community at large. Hanebado took itself too seriously for many viewers, while Salaryman's Club fumbled on aspects as simple as its basic premise. With two episodes currently available, Love All Play is striking a good balance between slice of life and sports. Mizushima Ryo and his friends stumbled into the badminton club by accident one day and never left. Now that they're reaching the end of middle school, they have to decide which high schools to attend. Ryo is offered a sports scholarship to a prominent high school, but this perfect chance doesn't go the way it's expected to. His family disapproves of the idea; they don't want him to depend on physical ability, so he decides to get into the school by way of his grades.  With a first episode focusing on school life, Episode 2 switches to badminton. In a practice meant to test the abilities of Ryo and other team hopefuls, the audience gets a glimpse of each character's skill level and personality. While Love All Play doesn't immediately seem like anything special, it has the potential to be a solid sports anime.

The following article contains spoilers for events in the Jujutsu Kaisen manga that have not yet occurred in the anime.It is no surprise to anime fans that there are a plethora of horrific ways to die in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. From being sliced into a thousand pieces by Ryomen Sukuna to becoming a curse oneself, there are many fates that either involve dying or directly leading to a horrific death.  RELATED: 10 Jujutsu Kaisen Characters Anime-Only Fans Want To Know More About Fighting curses and using magic abilities powered by negative emotions is a recipe for disaster alone. Throw in a cruel and corrupt sorcerer hierarchy, a couple of seemingly unbeatable characters on both sides, and a few cursed objects and fans have a gruesome show full of body horror and darkness.          Becoming A Cursed Spirit Is An Arduous Afterlife                 While becoming a curse sort of means that one is still alive (or at least their essence has continued), usually curses are formed from the deceased's negative emotions and spirit becoming a monster. So, in a way, it is an un-death sentence that happens after one's physical death.  It does not look like a particularly pleasant existence. The body and spirit are warped, the curse usually must stay in the same place, and they are forced to crawl around looking for things to kill and eat.          Turning Into A Finger Bearer Guarantees A Harsh Death                 A curse can then turn into a finger bearer, and while this seems like an upgrade from being the typical curse who leads a somewhat empty existence, becoming a finger bearer means that one has one of Sukuna's fingers. Anyone who has seen Jujutsu Kaisen knows that there is an awful fate for those who have one of Sukuna's fingers. They will either be hunted down by a jujutsu sorcerer or they will be killed by another, stronger cursed spirit. The only thing to do is hope for a more benevolent and quick death.          Being Possessed Like Geto Does Not Seem Fun                Suguru Geto was a sorcerer close to Gojo's level, but he still died at the hands of his former friend, whose infinity technique was seemingly unbeatable. After his death, Geto's body was possessed by an unknown force, thus creating Pseudo-Geto. RELATED: 5 Reasons Jujutsu Kaisen's Itadori Would Excel At U.A. (& 5 He Wouldn't) While being possessed was not Geto's cause of death, it was an unfortunate part of his death that makes his ultimate fate feel tragic. If in this universe, any essence of a deceased person remains or can still witness events on Earth, this fate would certainly sadden or disgust many who suffered it.          Having Juzo Turn Your Corpse Into Furniture Is After The Fact                 Juzo was a cursed spirit that had a flashy stint on the show. He offered somewhat of a twisted comic relief element, as he made furniture out of human bodies. Being killed by Juzo would be bad enough, but subsequently being turned into a coat hanger or a shoe rack would be brutal. Juzo disrespected the dead. So, dying by his cleaver does not seem optimal.          Sukuna Ripping Your Heart Out Is At Least Quick                There are many terrible ways Sukuna went about killing people in the show. He could raise city block with his thousands of slices, and he could rip someone's heart from their chest with a single, swift motion. While either of these fates would be equally horrific, one feels faster than the other.  In the show, Yuji Itadori was alive for a few moments before he perished from the heart-shaped hole in his chest. However, when Sukuna slices his victims up, they are usually dead instantly. There are still a lot of big mysteries about Sukuna, including his technique, so it could get much worse.          Being Eaten By A Curse Could Be Slow And Painful, But You Might Be UnConscious Of the few people who have been eaten or attacked by regular curses, few have done so while conscious. So, that is one saving grace of being eaten in the way that Yuji's former classmates almost were. However, it's not exactly a great fate, and it implies no small amount of pain and suffering.  RELATED: 5 My Hero Academia Student Who Could Be Sukuna's Vessel (& 5 Who Couldn't) On top of that, many curses take a while to kill their victims, and even if victims are saved, they often are not okay afterward. Fans saw this clearly with Yuji's former classmates who were both emotionally and physically damaged after they almost died.          Mahito's Idle Transfiguration Is The Epitome Of Body Horror  Some of the most gruesome and sad deaths in Jujutsu Kaisen have come at the hands of the relatively young cursed spirit, Mahito, who can warp souls and therefore warp peoples' bodies. Viewers first see this when he kills three unassuming high school students who were interrupting a movie.  When Mahito turned Junpei Yoshino into one of his mutated curses (and died shortly after), fans got to witness the extent of the horrors Mahito could unleash. Anyone who survived became a hungry curse constantly in pain until a sorcerer killed them.          The Finger Bearers Are Known For Dealing Terrible Deaths                During the Cursed Womb Arc, fans of the show got to see exactly what Gojo was talking about when he said that jujutsu sorcerers would come across gruesome scenes. In the Juvenile Detention Center, they found the mangled and warped bodies of two of the inmates. Both had died seemingly painful deaths.  Moments later, Yuji's hand was blown off as he tried to cut down the finger bearer, and his fingers were burned away when he tried to fight back. These cursed spirits were way above the first years' levels.          Burning To Death Is Slow And Painful End                 There are few deaths as slow and painful as burning alive, but that is exactly what happened to a bunch of diner employees as well as a few jujutsu sorcerers. When examining the power levels of Jujutsu Kaisen's villains, Jogo seemed weak, as his abilities fell short of Gojo's and he suffered a humiliating defeat.  His fire-based attacks and domain expansion proved to be too much for many characters in the show, and those who could not keep up were burned alive.          Being Stuck In Infinity Is Every Existentialist's Worst Nightmare                 It was noted several times throughout the show that Jujutsu Kaisen fan-favorite character, Satoru Gojo, was the strongest jujutsu sorcerer, and he even boasted that he might beat Ryomen Sukuna, himself. Gojo was so confident for good reason. His innate technique of limitless and infinity was one of the most powerful ever seen in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. Gojo could tap into the power of infinity. When Jogo was caught in Gojo's domain expansion, infinite void, the cursed spirit remarked on how he was being inundated with everything in existence such that he, himself, could not do anything, a psychologically devastating fate.

Sakura Haruno has always been one of Naruto's most controversial characters. Most of the fandom has very strong opinions about her and her role in the story, both good and bad. The fans who dislike Sakura point to her treatment of Naruto, her infatuation with Sasuke or her lack of combat skill early in the series. These points can be debated and argued over, but almost all dislike of Sakura has the same starting point.  Those who have a strong distaste for Sakura usually point to the third episode of the series, ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes"" as the beginning of their dislike. In this episode, Sakura mocks Naruto for his bad behavior and blames his annoying personality on his lack of parents. While Sakura's comment is highly insensitive and warrants some animosity, it doesn't capture the full situation. In this same episode, Naruto behaves far worse than Sakura yet doesn't receive nearly the same level of backlash from the fandom. RELATED: How Naruto’s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's          Naruto Violates His Teammates' Trust                 Sakura mocking Naruto for being an orphan is easily one of her most infamous scenes. Having a poor opinion of her because of it is somewhat earned, but it's hardly the worst thing that happens in the episode. Because Sakura has spurned Naruto's advances once again, he decides to impersonate Sasuke to learn more about Sakura's true feelings. He also attacks Sasuke unprovoked and ties him up so that he can't interfere. Even before they go on their first mission together, Naruto violates the trust of both of his new teammates. He essentially kidnaps his teammate to use his identity, then takes advantage of Sakura's feelings for Sasuke to learn private information about her. Before his plan falls apart, Naruto even attempts to ruin Sasuke's reputation with Sakura just so that she has a worse opinion of Sasuke than him.  The most problematic element of this episode is that Naruto uses this opportunity to almost kiss Sakura while disguised as Sasuke. Luckily, he is forced to leave before the kiss can happen, but Naruto almost crosses a very serious line. It seems a bit unfair that Sakura is judged so harshly for an offhanded offensive comment while Naruto isn't judged for manipulating and assaulting his teammates for personal gain. RELATED: Boruto FINALLY Introduces Naruto's Most Underrated - and Ominous - Upgrade          Sakura Has A Point                 It's fair to say that Sakura was overly mean to Naruto. Bringing up the fact that Naruto doesn't have parents to insult him was uncalled for and showed Sakura's privilege. That being said, her comment wasn't entirely wrong either; Naruto does act in a purposefully annoying and obnoxious way. In the first episode, we learn that it's because Naruto is trying to draw the attention of the people who usually ignore him. This makes Naruto sympathetic, but it doesn't excuse the fact that his behavior still has a real effect on people, which Sakura points out.  For as long as Sakura has known Naruto, he has constantly harassed her with romantic advances even though she has directly told him that she isn't interested. Naruto also interferes with her attempts to pursue a romantic relationship with Sasuke. Sakura's poor opinion of Naruto is honestly warranted. The fact that Naruto impersonates Sasuke and tries to manipulate her only proves her point. The belief that Naruto is an annoying brat is a belief held by most characters in the series, including Iruka and the Third Hokage. Sakura's statement that Naruto acts out and misbehaves because he doesn't have parents is true, and this is something that multiple other characters like Iruka and Kakashi have also stated. A lot of Naruto's behavior stems from the fact that he didn't have a parental figure to guide him for most of his life. Sakura's claim was accurate -- she just said it in a cruel way that didn't take Naruto's perspective into account.  RELATED: Power-Scaling 101: Can Naruto Destroy a Planet? - Attack Potency Explained          Sakura Learns a Lesson While Naruto Doesn't                 Although Sakura's treatment of Naruto was somewhat earned, she does recognize that she should be nicer to him. After being confronted about her behavior by Sasuke, Sakura learns to see things from Naruto's perspective. She understands that she has a privileged life compared to him and that he doesn't truly deserve all the hate that he gets. From that point on, Sakura makes an effort to be kind to Naruto and be his friend. Naruto, on the other hand, doesn't really learn a lesson from the experience. None of his teammates discover that he impersonated Sasuke or lied to Sakura. Naruto doesn't learn to respect Sakura's boundaries or be nicer to Sasuke. The only consequence he faces is an upset stomach from drinking expired milk. In this episode, Sakura grows from her lowest moment while Naruto doesn't, but Sakura still gets criticism for her actions.  Ultimately, the early episodes of Naruto shouldn't be used to judge any of the characters too harshly. The purpose of these episodes is to introduce the characters and point out their flaws. Sakura can be mean and insensitive at times, Naruto is obnoxious and self-focused, and Sasuke is antisocial and has an ego problem. Eventually, all of these characters overcome their flaws and grow as people.

RELATED: Power-Scaling 101: Can Naruto Destroy a Planet? - Attack Potency Explained          Sakura Learns a Lesson While Naruto Doesn't                 Although Sakura's treatment of Naruto was somewhat earned, she does recognize that she should be nicer to him. After being confronted about her behavior by Sasuke, Sakura learns to see things from Naruto's perspective. She understands that she has a privileged life compared to him and that he doesn't truly deserve all the hate that he gets. From that point on, Sakura makes an effort to be kind to Naruto and be his friend. Naruto, on the other hand, doesn't really learn a lesson from the experience. None of his teammates discover that he impersonated Sasuke or lied to Sakura. Naruto doesn't learn to respect Sakura's boundaries or be nicer to Sasuke. The only consequence he faces is an upset stomach from drinking expired milk. In this episode, Sakura grows from her lowest moment while Naruto doesn't, but Sakura still gets criticism for her actions.  Ultimately, the early episodes of Naruto shouldn't be used to judge any of the characters too harshly. The purpose of these episodes is to introduce the characters and point out their flaws. Sakura can be mean and insensitive at times, Naruto is obnoxious and self-focused, and Sasuke is antisocial and has an ego problem. Eventually, all of these characters overcome their flaws and grow as people.

Home Anime My Hero Academia's All For One Offers a Startling New Theory on Villainy    My Hero Academia's All For One Offers a Startling New Theory on Villainy  By Louis Kemner Published 10 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In MHA: Vigilantes Volume 12, All For One's new theory on Quirks and the human psyche is the series' most insightful yet.                  The following contains spoilers for My Hero Academia: Vigilantes Vol. 12, by Kohei Horikoshi, Hideyuki Furuhashi and Betten Court, available in English now through Viz Media.   My Hero Academia presents a bizarre and tense future where superpowered Quirks are a fact of life, but it's not all fun and games when almost everyone has special abilities. In fact, the proliferation of Quirks has arguably caused more problems than it solved, and all sorts of prejudices, mental health issues and other social ills have resulted from people being born with powers they cannot fully handle.  Heroes and villains may be on opposite sides of the battle for society, but both sides understand how intertwined Quirks have become with society and the human condition. In Volume 12 of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, the symbol of evil, All For One, offers yet another fascinating insight into how humanity and Quirks mesh. This villain seems to understand the philosophy of Quirks better than anyone else in MHA. RELATED: My Hero Academia Finally Reveals Dabi's Backstory          All For One's Theory On True Villainy & Quirks                During a flashback taking place several years before Midoriya Izuku's arrival at the UA school, All For One plays a role in the spread of the drug known as Trigger, which can overload people's Quirks and create ""instant villains"". Characters such as Koichi and Knuckleduster must contend with this, but All For One is not actually recruiting these people to the official League of Villains at all. Instead, he takes advantage of how a person's psyche and Quirk may be imbalanced, and that disconnect is what creates a villain in the eyes of society.  All For One further explains to his minion Kurogiri that by society's standards, when a person's Quirk and their will are in harmony, that creates the stable resolve of a potential hero. This person will most likely have full control of both their Quirk and their attitude, and won't go on a rampage or deviate from society's norms. But if a person's extreme or violent will causes them to abuse their Quirk -- or if a burdensome Quirk warps their mind -- the result is a dangerous imbalance that causes the person to break out of their ""pigeonhole"" of society and become a deviant, aka a villain.  In short, the harmony or lack thereof between a citizen and their Quirk is what makes for a villain or not, regardless of whether it's a caped Pro Hero or a member of the League of Villains. The sheer stress and turmoil found in such an individual may cause them to lose control or decide to break the law so they can seek inner peace or get material goods. Many characters in My Hero Academia support this new theory. RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army          The Quirk Disharmony Of My Hero Academia's Villains                Several members of the League of Villains embody the philosophy All For One describes in MHA: Vigilantes Volume 12. A primary example is his own protégé, the vicious Shigaraki Tomura, whose equally brutal Decay Quirk warped the boy's mind and shattered his world when he was young.  Years ago, Shimura Tenko was a relatively normal child who looked up to heroes such as his grandmother Nana. When his Quirk activated, however, he accidentally killed his entire family, and was highly impressionable and vulnerable when All For One recruited him. AFO took advantage of the mind-Quirk disconnect in Tenko, renaming him Shigaraki Tomura and putting severed hands all over his body to stoke his rage and pain. Had he been born with a more pleasant Quirk, he never would have become a villain at all. RELATED: My Hero Academia Teases the Final One For All Quirk - and Toga's Revenge Another example is the crafty Toga Himiko, whose reckless mentality made her unsuitable for mainstream society -- especially when paired with her unpopular blood-based Quirk. Everyone found her power disgusting and strange, and when she openly embraced it after years of hiding it, she became a true villain in the eyes of society and All For One alike. Toga is an example of, in AFO's own words, an ""extreme and violent will"" taking charge of a Quirk and letting it run amok.  Something similar could be said about Toga's League ally Dabi, whose ""extreme and violent"" will is directed against his father Endeavor. Dabi puts his fire Quirk to use not to save people, but to seek revenge against his family and tear down the heroic society his father stands for. Mainstream society and All For One alike agree: that makes him a true villain.

The following article contains spoilers for Tiger & Bunny 2 Episode 5, ""Live and Let Live,"" now streaming on Netflix.   With each of the early episodes of Tiger & Bunny 2 focusing on a different pair of buddies, it was inevitable the anime series would get to an episode spotlighting Rock Bison and Origami Cyclone -- perhaps the most mismatched duo to date, from which Episode 5 mines its central conflict.  The veteran Rock Bison -- real name Antonio Lopez -- is a bruiser, courtesy of his powerful physique and Impenetrable Skin NEXT ability. In comparison, Origami Cyclone, AKA Ivan Karelin, is a scrawny young hotshot who lacks any semblance of super strength. Instead, his shape-shifting powers encourage a more stealth-based approach to missions. RELATED: Avatar: Aang's Flaws Are What Made Him a Great Hero                Their differences almost prove irreconcilable when Rock Bison inadvertently insults his new partner. Kotetsu finds the bovine hero drowning his sorrows in a bar and, after prying, discovers that Bison drunkenly told his partner that he came across more as an ""Origami Soft Breeze"" than a cyclone.  The event causes Origami Cyclone to stop talking to Rock Bison altogether, which seems an overly dramatic reaction on the surface. However, it's revealed to Barnaby that the reason Ivan Karelin is so precious about his hero name is due to the event that kick-started his desire to become one in the first place. As a child, Karelin was bullied for his NEXT powers, being considered a freak by his peers. That all changed when he and his classmates were caught in a typhoon on a camping trip. His teachers were preoccupied with preventing the nearby river from flooding, leaving the class terrified and alone in the log cabin they were staying in.  RELATED: Sonic X Is Still the Best Sonic Cartoon Ever                To make his classmates feel safe, Karelin shape-shifted into their teacher, reassuring them through the stormy night. It was as a result of that night that Karelin chose the name ""Cyclone,"" representing the trial by fire he underwent. After Rock Bison tries and fails to make amends with Origami Cyclone, the duo comes across a bank robbery in progress. It's during the robbery that the reason they were paired up becomes apparent: Origami is able to distract the robbers with his shape-shifting abilities, while Bison is able to deal with them physically.  Then, in a callback to his first night as a hero, Origami is able to reassure the hostages by transforming into a comforting figure -- in this case, Barnaby. What seemed like diametrically opposed powersets at first end up being the perfect complements for each other, and Bison commends his partner as worthy of the epithet Cyclone. They reconcile, and like Fire Emblem and Sky High before them, vow to become the Kings of Buddy Heroes together. RELATED: Demon Slayer's Epic Anniversary Event Will be Livestreamed Worldwide                While the brunt of the episode's focus is on Rock Bison and Origami Cyclone, Barnaby also gets a side plot. Mattia, the red-headed scientist who appeared in the third episode's post-credits scene, shows up at a hero signing, where it's revealed that he and Barnaby were childhood friends. The two reconnect, and the episode ends with them getting dinner together -- although with no mention made of Mattia's prior ominous declaration that he would beat Barnaby.  Meanwhile, in this episode's post-credits, the villainous Fugan and Mugan discuss with their benefactor Brahe their desire to defeat thirty-six superheroes -- and with twenty down already, it's likely that the heroes of Stern Bild City will soon be in their crosshairs.

Home Anime Spy x Family Briefly Explores the Gentle Parenting Method    Spy x Family Briefly Explores the Gentle Parenting Method  By Kelvin Kwao Published 8 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The season premiere of the new Spy x Family anime impressively displayed the core concepts of gentle parenting.                  The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Episode 1, “Operation Strix,” now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The Spy x Family anime adaptation is one of the most anticipated of the spring 2022 season, and even with just one episode out, the Wit Studio/CloverWorks collaboration seems headed for greatness. The premiere delivered on its promise of a fun spy adventure, but with it came an unexpected lesson on gentle parenting.  Gentle parenting is a movement that has seen increased popularity across social media in recent times. It prescribes a more child-centered approach to parenting where kids are empowered, encouraging them to respond positively to their parent's attempts to foster a healthy relationship. Principles such as mutual respect for boundaries, empathy and understanding are celebrated by ""gentle parents"" and while results might be slowly recognized in real life, Spy x Family perfectly illustrates the visionary concept and its benefits. RELATED: Spy x Family Reveals English Cast and Earlier Than Expected Premiere Date                  Spy x Family follows Twilight, a world-renowned spy and unemotional master of disguise, as he attempts his most important mission yet: pretending to be an average family man in order to gain access to a reclusive political leader. This latest disguise wouldn't be complete without a child of his own. Enter 12-year-old telepath and the world's cutest spy assistant ever, Anya. After a disturbingly easy adoption process, Twilight soon finds that raising a child might be one of those activities that were outside his expansive scope of expertise. Try as he might, he couldn't seem to understand Anya's perfectly normal sudden fits of confusion and excitement, so he turned to some parenting books to help improve their relationship.  RELATED: Spy x Family Creator Debuts Dynamic New Art Celebrating the Anime's Premiere                 The parenting manuals provided some stellar advice, reminding Twilight that the key to building a relationship with any child is trust. He learned that it would be better to try to understand Anya's point of view instead of scolding her. She often acts in a confusing manner because for all her ""genius"", she is still a child who struggles to put her feelings into words. Armed with this information, Twilight re-engaged Anya and approached their relationship anew. Being a telepath, Anya readily responded to Twilight's renewed attempts. Since she could recognize his genuine desire to do right by her -- and the delicate position his career as her spy put him in -- she conducted herself with a sense of maturity no average six-year-old could.  In her position, anyone, especially a curious toddler, would be perfectly within their rights to ask more than a few questions. But since she understood the reasons behind Twilight's secretive manner, Anya was happy to go along with his half-baked explanations, even internally teasing him at points.

16-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.cbr.com/spy-x-family-briefly-episode-1-spoilers-twilight-anya-gentle-parenting/,How Spy x Family Episode 1 Explores the Gentle Parenting Method,"      Home Anime Spy x Family Briefly Explores the Gentle Parenting Method    Spy x Family Briefly Explores the Gentle Parenting Method  By Kelvin Kwao Published 8 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The season premiere of the new Spy x Family anime impressively displayed the core concepts of gentle parenting.                  The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Episode 1, “Operation Strix,” now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The Spy x Family anime adaptation is one of the most anticipated of the spring 2022 season, and even with just one episode out, the Wit Studio/CloverWorks collaboration seems headed for greatness. The premiere delivered on its promise of a fun spy adventure, but with it came an unexpected lesson on gentle parenting.  Gentle parenting is a movement that has seen increased popularity across social media in recent times. It prescribes a more child-centered approach to parenting where kids are empowered, encouraging them to respond positively to their parent's attempts to foster a healthy relationship. Principles such as mutual respect for boundaries, empathy and understanding are celebrated by ""gentle parents"" and while results might be slowly recognized in real life, Spy x Family perfectly illustrates the visionary concept and its benefits. RELATED: Spy x Family Reveals English Cast and Earlier Than Expected Premiere Date                  Spy x Family follows Twilight, a world-renowned spy and unemotional master of disguise, as he attempts his most important mission yet: pretending to be an average family man in order to gain access to a reclusive political leader. This latest disguise wouldn't be complete without a child of his own. Enter 12-year-old telepath and the world's cutest spy assistant ever, Anya. After a disturbingly easy adoption process, Twilight soon finds that raising a child might be one of those activities that were outside his expansive scope of expertise. Try as he might, he couldn't seem to understand Anya's perfectly normal sudden fits of confusion and excitement, so he turned to some parenting books to help improve their relationship.  RELATED: Spy x Family Creator Debuts Dynamic New Art Celebrating the Anime's Premiere                 The parenting manuals provided some stellar advice, reminding Twilight that the key to building a relationship with any child is trust. He learned that it would be better to try to understand Anya's point of view instead of scolding her. She often acts in a confusing manner because for all her ""genius"", she is still a child who struggles to put her feelings into words. Armed with this information, Twilight re-engaged Anya and approached their relationship anew. Being a telepath, Anya readily responded to Twilight's renewed attempts. Since she could recognize his genuine desire to do right by her -- and the delicate position his career as her spy put him in -- she conducted herself with a sense of maturity no average six-year-old could.  In her position, anyone, especially a curious toddler, would be perfectly within their rights to ask more than a few questions. But since she understood the reasons behind Twilight's secretive manner, Anya was happy to go along with his half-baked explanations, even internally teasing him at points. Their relationship has only just begun but is sure to become even more wholesome as Spy x Family's story moves forward.

No matter how faithful the animators and showrunners may be to the source material, adapting a manga to anime on a one-to-one basis is simply impossible. Not only that, but doing so is impractical and even detrimental to the final product.  RELATED: 10 Anime That Should Have Ended In The Very First Season As such, adaptational changes like reducing certain characters' prominence is both necessary and unavoidable. Though these characters were important and even integral to the manga, the opposite was true for their animated incarnations. WARNING: Spoilers ahead.   10          Berserk (1997) — The Count & Rosine Only Got Cameos                After barely surviving The Eclipse and seeing everyone he loved get brutally murdered, Guts waged a seemingly endless war against the Apostles. Two of his victims were The Count and Rosine, a previously morally twisted man and an abused child, respectively, who turned to the God Hand during their lowest moments.  These Apostles' deaths were some of Berserk's most tragic moments, and their demises paved the way for Guts toning down his bloodlust. Meanwhile, in the 1997 anime, The Count and Rosine were just cameos. At most, The Count was shown to be Pipin's killer, but Guts never avenged his comrade's death like he did in the manga.  9          Hellsing (2001) — Enrico Maxwell Became An Annoying Bureaucrat                 The Hellsing Organization's closest rival is Iscariot (or Vatican Section XIII). Unlike Hellsing, the Vatican's top-secret army aims to exterminate anything ""unholy,"" including the supernatural and Protestants. Iscariot was led by the fanatical Enrico, and he was everything that Integra was not. Specifically, he was a madman drunk with power.  None of Enrico's maniacal side was present in the first Hellsing anime, which isn't all that surprising given how drastically different it was from the manga. Here, Iscariot was a nuisance and red tape for Hellsing to deal with. Iscariot and Enrico only showed up in one episode, and they were forgotten afterwards.  8          Sailor Moon (1992) — The Amazoness Quartet Didn't Become The Heroines They Were Meant To Be                 As an adaptation of its manga, the original Sailor Moon fell short in many regards. Many of the characters suffered during their move from manga to anime, but this was most evident in the villains who became flat evil caricatures instead of complex foes. The Amazoness Quartet Cere Cere, Palla Palla, Jun Jun, and Ves Ves, are perfect examples.  RELATED: The 10 Best Shojo Heroines Of All Time, Ranked In the manga, they were Sailor Guardians based in the Amazon who were brainwashed by Queen Nehelenia. Once they realized this, they broke free of her control and returned for the final fight as the heroic Asteroid Guardians. In the anime, the four were Queen Nehelenia's minions from the start, and they betrayed their boss when they became fed up with her.  7          Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail — Dutch's Shady Past & Lies Were Excised                 Besides being one of Black Lagoon's longest manga arcs, what made ""El Baile De La Muerte"" so important was that it exposed a lot about the main characters. One major revelation was that Dutch lied about his backstory as a Vietnam War veteran, and his real past literally put a target on his back in the current arc ""L'Homme Sombre.""  None of this is mentioned in the former's OVA adaptation Roberta's Blood Trail, where Dutch was pushed to the sidelines more than usual. To be fair, this was probably cut for pacing's sake. Right now, there are no new anime announcements for Black Lagoon, making a tease for a future arc and Dutch's true identity unnecessary.  6          Akira — Lady Miyako Became A Fraud & Died On A Bridge                 Anyone unfamiliar with Akira's epic source material would be surprised to know that not only does the movie cover three of six volumes, but its events are the prequel to a post-apocalyptic battle for Japan's future. As such, many characters had their original roles reduced, with Lady Miyako being one of the biggest casualties.  In the manga, Lady Miyako led a cult dedicated to Akira and, later, a resistance against Tetsuo's so-called Great Tokyo Empire. What's more, she was a former Esper who died trying to stop Tetsuo. In the movie, Lady Miyako was a background character who, at most, was hinted to be a religious huckster who randomly died during Tetsuo's rampage.  5          Another — Tomohiko Kazami Lost His Cool & Died                 As is the case with many anime adaptations, Another changed parts of its story to better fit a serialized format. One of these adjustments was reducing some of Class 3-3's screen time to focus on Kouichi and Mei. The model student Tomohiko was reduced to a bit player who snapped during the finale and killed two people before dying.  Not only did Tomohiko survive in the manga, but he was one of the class' most dependable and sane members. Originally, Tomohiko was a core member of Kouchi's friend group that tried to get to the bottom of their class' death curse. Tomohiko was gravely injured during a scuffle, but he lived and spent the rest of Another recovering in a hospital.  4          Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters — Ryou Bakura Only Showed Up For The Canon Arcs                 The most popular animated adaptation of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise was filled with anime-original arcs, resulting in the main characters getting more screen time and development than ever before. The one exception was Bakura, who was a walking plot device who only appeared whenever Yami/Yugi Muto and friends bumped into Egyptian lore.  In the manga, Bakura was an honorary part of Yugi's group. More importantly, his battle with his evil split personality was fleshed out during adventures that didn't focus on him or Egyptian mythos. Conversely, the anime left Bakura out during filler arcs and breather episodes, making it seem as if he were only needed for plot progression.  3          Dragon Ball — Yamcha Devolved Into Cannon Fodder                 One of the sprawling Dragon Ball franchise's most enduring constants is Yamcha being the butt of every joke. Whether he was in a manga or anime, Yamcha was destined to be pushed to the sidelines despite being one of Goku's first rivals and Bulma's original love interest. That said, his anime appearances gave him more humiliations than usual.  RELATED: 10 Times Plot Armor Ruined Dragon Ball The non-canon Dragon Ball GT only gave Yamcha cameos that revealed he went back to his solitary desert life. He's also a lot weaker in the anime, where he's quickly defeated by anime-only foes to establish their threat. Yamcha also lost many times in the manga, but he still won his fair share of fights, and he held his own better than his anime counterpart did.  2          Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) — Selim Bradley Was Killed Very Early Into The Story                Fullmetal Alchemist's big mystery was Father's seven Homunculi's identity, some of who were hiding in plain sight. A great example of this was Pride, who turned out to be Führer King Bradley's seemingly innocent son, Selim. As his true name implies, Selim is an incredibly arrogant and sadistic brat who took immense joy in killing his victims.  If Selim was Pride in the manga and reboot Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, he was a plot device in the manga's first anime. Here, Selim was a genuinely good boy who was killed off-screen to establish King Bradley's barely containted rage and his true identity as Pride. By contrast, King Bradley was Wrath in the text, and he actually feared Selim.  1          The Promised Neverland — The One Was Reduced To A Speechless Still Image                 In The Promised Neverland's infamous series finale, a quick montage of Emma wrapping things up in the Demon World was shown. One of her stopovers was with a small Demon leaning on a giant dragon. The anime only gave this meeting five seconds, despite the Demon being one of the manga's most important characters.  The Demon was known as ""The One,"" and he was essentially the Demons' god. Emma bargained with The One for all the children's safe passage to the Human World, but at the price of her memories. The One being relegated to a single still image was just one of The Promised Neverland's offenses towards one of Shonen Jump's more recent hits.
