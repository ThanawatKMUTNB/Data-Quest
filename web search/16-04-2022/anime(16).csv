Interest Fate/Extra Illustrator Arco Wada Gets Artbook, Exhibition   posted on 2022-04-14 06:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         July exhibit will celebrate game's 12th anniversary    Illustrator Arco Wada is getting an artbook and exhibition in July focusing on their work on the Fate/Extra game, which will celebrate its 12th anniversary on July 22. The exhibit will run from July 21 to August 9 in the MATSUYA GINZA department store. The exhibit venue will sell an early print of the artbook, and Type-Moon Books will release it in bookstores from July 29.    Ticket details will be announced at a later date.    Marvelous Entertainment and Type-Moon released the Fate/Extra PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2010. Aksys Games released the game in North America in November 2011. The Fate/Extra CCC companion game shipped in Japan on the PSP in March 2013. The games are set in an alternate science-fiction continuity of Type-Moon's Fate universe, often referred to by fans as the ""Extraverse.""    The games inspired SHAFT's 10-episode television anime Fate/Extra Last Encore in January 2018. Netflix began streaming the anime outside of Japan on June 30, 2018. The three-episode Fate/Extra Last Encore: Illustrias Tendōsetsu (Illustrias Geocentrism) special then debuted in July 2018.    Marvelous released Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star, a new ""Extraverse"" game, for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in November 2016. XSEED Games released the game in the West in January 2017, and on the PC and Switch in July 2017. Fate/EXTELLA LINK, an enhanced version of the game, shipped in Japan in June 2018, and XSEED Games released the game in March 2019.    Type-Moon studio BB, the Type-Moon game and story development circle's new game studio, announced in 2020 that it is developing a remake of Fate/Extra, titled Fate/Extra Record. The announcement celebrates the game's 10th anniversary. The announcement did not reveal a platform or a release date.

Interest Fate/Extra Illustrator Arco Wada Gets Artbook, Exhibition   posted on 2022-04-14 06:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         July exhibit will celebrate game's 12th anniversary    Illustrator Arco Wada is getting an artbook and exhibition in July focusing on their work on the Fate/Extra game, which will celebrate its 12th anniversary on July 22. The exhibit will run from July 21 to August 9 in the MATSUYA GINZA department store. The exhibit venue will sell an early print of the artbook, and Type-Moon Books will release it in bookstores from July 29.    Ticket details will be announced at a later date.    Marvelous Entertainment and Type-Moon released the Fate/Extra PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2010. Aksys Games released the game in North America in November 2011. The Fate/Extra CCC companion game shipped in Japan on the PSP in March 2013. The games are set in an alternate science-fiction continuity of Type-Moon's Fate universe, often referred to by fans as the ""Extraverse.""    The games inspired SHAFT's 10-episode television anime Fate/Extra Last Encore in January 2018. Netflix began streaming the anime outside of Japan on June 30, 2018. The three-episode Fate/Extra Last Encore: Illustrias Tendōsetsu (Illustrias Geocentrism) special then debuted in July 2018.    Marvelous released Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star, a new ""Extraverse"" game, for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in November 2016. XSEED Games released the game in the West in January 2017, and on the PC and Switch in July 2017. Fate/EXTELLA LINK, an enhanced version of the game, shipped in Japan in June 2018, and XSEED Games released the game in March 2019.    Type-Moon studio BB, the Type-Moon game and story development circle's new game studio, announced in 2020 that it is developing a remake of Fate/Extra, titled Fate/Extra Record. The announcement celebrates the game's 10th anniversary. The announcement did not reveal a platform or a release date.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

This is a game that throws you head-first into the depths of its myriad gameplay systems with only a half-inflated life vest while telling you that you need to learn to swim right now. ― SaGa Frontier is a game whose original release could best be described as unfortunate.

Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream. Todd Ciolek has the lowdown on every title in this collection. ― Last year's NES Classic Edition was a finely crafted piece of nostalgia: an authentically miniature Nintendo Entertainment System with thirty built-in games, ranging from enduring classics to dispo...                    game review          25 comments       Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite   2017 Sep 27, 00:00 25 comments                 games    Several changes have been made to this fighting game's new installment, but not all of them are for the better. Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes. Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation.

The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company?

On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together?

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades.

True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky.

Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

This is a game that throws you head-first into the depths of its myriad gameplay systems with only a half-inflated life vest while telling you that you need to learn to swim right now. ― SaGa Frontier is a game whose original release could best be described as unfortunate.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream. Todd Ciolek has the lowdown on every title in this collection. ― Last year's NES Classic Edition was a finely crafted piece of nostalgia: an authentically miniature Nintendo Entertainment System with thirty built-in games, ranging from enduring classics to dispo...                    game review          25 comments       Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite   2017 Sep 27, 00:00 25 comments                 games    Several changes have been made to this fighting game's new installment, but not all of them are for the better. Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes. Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one.

The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine.

Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.

The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).

Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain.

Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.    Rating:                 Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 is currently streaming on Funimation.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

News Double Live-Action Show Reveals 10 Cast Members   posted on 2022-04-13 05:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Kazue Tsumeta, Tsukumo Todoroki, Aki Imagire, Hanae Funato, more join cast    The staff for the live-action series adaptation of Ayako Noda's Double manga revealed 10 cast members on Wednesday.     The newly announced cast includes (from left to right starting with third image on top row):    Nanami Sakuraba as Kazue Tsumeta  Horii Arata as Tsukumo Todoroki   Haruka Kudō as Aki Imagire  Misuzu Kanno as Hanae Funato   Kanji Tsuda as Sо̄ichi Kurozu  Shunya Itabashi as Akio Mizuno   Tomoya Maeno as Tatsuhiko Kawakami  Ron Mizuma as Shinya Nagata   Jun Hashimoto as Director   Shinobu Nakayama as Minami Kamino    The series will premiere on WOWOW Prime, WOWOW 4K, and WOWOW on Demand services on June 4. Yudai Chiba (left in image below) and Kento Nagayama (right) star as Takara and Yuujin, respectively.     Kazuhiro Nakagawa (Shin Godzilla assistant director) is directing the series, with scripts by Eriko Yoshida (Tiger & Bunny: The Comic).    Tokyopop licensed the manga, and it released the first volume on January 25. The company describes the manga:   Yuujin Kamoshima and Takara Takarada are fellow actors in the same theater troupe who live next door to one another, with similar day to day lives.   Though they aren't exactly close friends, when Yuujin is cast as Takara's double, he sees first hand his extraordinary acting skills and is blown away. From that moment on, he's determined to help him succeed and support him in his dream of becoming a world renowned actor, even if Yuujin has to be in his shadow. But as the acting world begins to take notice, that's easier said than done...   The manga debuted on Hero's Inc.'s Flat Hero's website in January 2019. The manga's fourth compiled book volume shipped in Japan in May 2021.    The manga won the Excellence Award at the 23rd Japan Media Arts Festival in 2020.    The publisher futekiya has licensed three of Noda's boys' love manga under the pen name Niboshiko Arai: Inga no Sakana, Gatapishi, and Adana wo Kure.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko.

We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes.

It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.

I know pretty much nothing about JJK other than it's not my cup of tea, but I am so in love with some of the cast that I may watch this of they do a livestream and it's not region-locked!   Ryuji is an absolute beast and I love him in everything I've seen him in. Truly a remarkable actor who has limitless energy. He's done multiple 1 1/2-2 hour solo performances with multiple costume changes with no breaks. It's incredible to watch.   Ray is another phenomenal actor! It's always such a treat to watch him! Masanari is also wonderful! I've only seen him in the drama King of Dance, but I really enjoyed his performance! Some of his stage performances are on my long list of plays to watch like KHR and TouSute. Kazuaki is great! I've seen him in Sanrio Danshi and Kyoto Samurai Boys and enjoyed both performances!   And Mokkun (Motohiro Ota)! I love Mokkun so much. He is an absolute treasure! His performance as Yuko in XXXHolic was stellar! He's also fantastic as Sengo in TouMyu. I do want to see his non-2.5D performances.   These actors (and likely the other actors and actresses I'm not familiar with) are very athletic and can certainly benchpress more than their cellphone. I'm so excited!

I know pretty much nothing about JJK other than it's not my cup of tea, but I am so in love with some of the cast that I may watch this of they do a livestream and it's not region-locked!   Ryuji is an absolute beast and I love him in everything I've seen him in. Truly a remarkable actor who has limitless energy. He's done multiple 1 1/2-2 hour solo performances with multiple costume changes with no breaks. It's incredible to watch.   Ray is another phenomenal actor! It's always such a treat to watch him! Masanari is also wonderful! I've only seen him in the drama King of Dance, but I really enjoyed his performance! Some of his stage performances are on my long list of plays to watch like KHR and TouSute. Kazuaki is great! I've seen him in Sanrio Danshi and Kyoto Samurai Boys and enjoyed both performances!   And Mokkun (Motohiro Ota)! I love Mokkun so much. He is an absolute treasure! His performance as Yuko in XXXHolic was stellar! He's also fantastic as Sengo in TouMyu. I do want to see his non-2.5D performances.   These actors (and likely the other actors and actresses I'm not familiar with) are very athletic and can certainly benchpress more than their cellphone. I'm so excited!

I know pretty much nothing about JJK other than it's not my cup of tea, but I am so in love with some of the cast that I may watch this of they do a livestream and it's not region-locked!   Ryuji is an absolute beast and I love him in everything I've seen him in. Truly a remarkable actor who has limitless energy. He's done multiple 1 1/2-2 hour solo performances with multiple costume changes with no breaks. It's incredible to watch.   Ray is another phenomenal actor! It's always such a treat to watch him! Masanari is also wonderful! I've only seen him in the drama King of Dance, but I really enjoyed his performance! Some of his stage performances are on my long list of plays to watch like KHR and TouSute. Kazuaki is great! I've seen him in Sanrio Danshi and Kyoto Samurai Boys and enjoyed both performances!   And Mokkun (Motohiro Ota)! I love Mokkun so much. He is an absolute treasure! His performance as Yuko in XXXHolic was stellar! He's also fantastic as Sengo in TouMyu. I do want to see his non-2.5D performances.   These actors (and likely the other actors and actresses I'm not familiar with) are very athletic and can certainly benchpress more than their cellphone.

Kento Yamazaki, Ryō Yoshizawa, and Kanna Hashimoto are all reprising their respective characters Shin (Xin), Ei Sei (Yin Zheng), and Ka Ryō Ten (He Liao Diao) from the previous film. Tsutomu Kuroiwa (One Piece Film Gold, live-action Black Butler, GANTZ:O) joins Satō and Hara in writing the script, and  Yutaka Yamada (Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, live-action Bleach) is composing the music.

Shueisha published the 64th compiled book volume on February 18. Hara said he is considering writing up to 100 volumes.    A television anime adaptation premiered in 2012, and a second season premiered in 2013. Funimation streamed the series in North America and released both seasons on DVD in 2016.

News Live-Action Kingdom Film Sequel Casts Chihiro Yamamoto as Kyō Shō   posted on 2022-04-14 13:04 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Yamamoto plays Kyō Kai's adoptive sister in July 15 film    This year's 20th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine announced a new cast member for Kingdom II: Harukanaru Daichi e (To Distant Lands), the sequel film based on Yasuhisa Hara's Kingdom manga, on Thursday. Chihiro Yamamoto will play Kyō Shō (Qiang Xiang), Kyō Kai's adoptive sister.        The film's staff also debuted new visuals on Thursday:         The film's new cast members also feature:    Amane Okayama as Bi Hei   Takahiro Miura as Bitо̄   Takayuki Hamatsu as Taku Kei    The cast includes Nana Seino as Kyо̄ Kai and Kento Yamazaki as Shin. These five characters are part of an infantry together (pictured above).     Other new cast members include (left to right in image above):     Tsutomu Takahashi as Kyū Gen   Yukiyoshi Ozawa as Go Kei   Etsushi Toyokawa as Duke Hyō   Kiyohiko Shibukawa as Baku Koshin       Shinsuke Satō (live-action Gantz, Death Note Light up the NEW world, Bleach) is returning as director. Kento Yamazaki, Ryō Yoshizawa, and Kanna Hashimoto are all reprising their respective characters Shin (Xin), Ei Sei (Yin Zheng), and Ka Ryō Ten (He Liao Diao) from the previous film. Tsutomu Kuroiwa (One Piece Film Gold, live-action Black Butler, GANTZ:O) joins Satō and Hara in writing the script, and  Yutaka Yamada (Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, live-action Bleach) is composing the music. Mr. Children contributes the  theme song ""Ikiro"" (Live).    The film will open on July 15.      The first film opened in Japan in April 2019 and sold 506,861 tickets to earn 690,219,500 yen (about US$6.17 million) in its first three days. The film later sold a total of 4.11 million tickets for 5,471,938,400 yen (about US$50.42 million), and eventually earned a cumulative total of 5.73 billion yen (about US$53.2 million). Funimation screened the film at Anime Expo in July 2019, and began screening the film in theaters in the United States and Canada in August 2019.    Hara's historical manga began with the slave boy Xin and his dream of becoming a great general for the state of Qin. Xin helps Ying Zheng, the young Qin king who shares his desire to unify China, rise to power within the state. Xin does all he can to become a superior commander of an army capable of defeating the Seven Warring States.    The record-setting manga launched in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in 2006. Shueisha published the 64th compiled book volume on February 18. Hara said he is considering writing up to 100 volumes.    A television anime adaptation premiered in 2012, and a second season premiered in 2013. Funimation streamed the series in North America and released both seasons on DVD in 2016. The third anime series based on Yasuhisa Hara's Kingdom manga premiered on NHK General in April 2020.     The anime's fourth season premiered on NHK General on April 9 at 24:00 (effectively April 10 at 12:00 a.m.).

News Shirow Miwa, Hikaru Sakurai Work on New Fate Novels   posted on 2022-04-13 12:57 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         New story centers on new Servants Aslaug, Ragnar Lodbrok, new Master Remina Eltfrom    Manga creator and artist Shirow Miwa revealed on Tuesday that he is drawing the art for a new light novel series for Type-Moon's Fate franchise titled Fate: Lost Einherjar - Kyokkō no Aslaug (Aslaug of the Aurora). Writer Hikaru Sakurai penning the novels.     The books will center on the Servants Aslaug and Ragnar Lodbrok, and their Master Remina Eltfrom. Aslaug is the valkyrie daughter of Sigurd and Brynhildr, while Ragnar Lodbrok is the semi-historical and legendary Viking figure, who is also said in some sagas to be Aslaug's husband.     The 14th volume of Kadokawa's Type-Moon Ace magazine published the prologue of the story on Tuesday. The release date for the first novel has not yet been revealed.    Miwa previously drew the Servants Sigurd and Brynhildr for the Fate/Grand Order smartphone game, but also noted in 2020 that he had unoficially drawn many of the other characters from the Völsunga saga, and at the time had not yet shown them to Type-Moon, but expressed hope that they would be used in a Scandinavian-themed story at some point.    Miwa serialized the original Dogs manga (retitled as Dogs: Prelude in English) in Ultra Jump from 2000 to 2001, and Shueisha released one compiled book. Miwa then ran the Dogs: Bullets & Carnage sequel in Shueisha's Ultra Jump magazine in 2005, and Shueisha released the 10th compiled book volume in 2014. The manga inspired an original video anime (OVA) in 2009. Miwa also drew a manga adaptation of the RWBY web animated series that ran in Ultra Jump from November 2015 to February 2017. Miwa drafted the original character designs for the Joker Game and Kiznaiver television anime.    Sakurai has penned many stories in Type-Moon's Fate franchise, including many scenarios in Fate/Grand Order, the Fate/Extella game, the Fate/Extra Last Encore anime, and the Fate/Prototype: Fragments of Sky Silver. Prior to her involvement with Type-Moon, she was a prominent writer of Liar-soft's visual novels, and wrote the company's Steampunk Series novels.
